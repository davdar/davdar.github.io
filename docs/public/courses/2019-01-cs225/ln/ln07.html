# Interpretation of Variables

First, we will only consider the meaning of variables which occur inside
well-defined terms, that is, those that are in scope. To check that a term is
well-defined, it must be “closed”, meaning the top-level term has no free
variables.

The meaning of a variable is then given via *substitution*:

    interp(LET x = e₁ IN e₂) ≜ interp([e₁/x]e₂)

The interpretation of a variable is then undefined (`BadA`). The syntactic
check for a program being closed is then a useful check that makes sure the
`interp(x)` case never happens, and that `BadA` is never the result of a
program due to a variable not being in scope.

Non-trivial fact: this definition is well defined (i.e., the interpreter will
always terminate).

We are going to write `e₁ ≈ e₂` to mean `interp(e₁) = interp(e₂)`.

The notation `[e₁/x]e₂` means “look at all sub-expresions in `e₂` and replace
all occurrences of the variable `x` with `e₁`.

E.g.:

    [1 + 1/x]x = 1 + 1
    [1 + 1/x](x + y) = (1 + 1) + y
    [1 + 1/x](IF x THEN x ELSE 1) = IF 1 + 1 THEN 1 + 1 else 1
    [1 + 1/x](LET y = x IN x + y) = LET y = 1 + 1 IN (1 + 1) + y ≈ (1 + 1) + (1 + 1) ≈ 4
    [1 + 1/x](LET x = 4 IN x + x) = LET x = 4 IN x + x ≈ 4 + 4 ≈ 8
    [1 + 1/x](LET x = x IN x + x) = LET x = (1 + 1) IN x + x ≈ (1 + 1) + (1 + 1) ≈ 4

substitution is formally defined:

    [_/_]_ ∈ expr × var × expr → expr
    [e/x]i ≜ i
    [e/x](e₁ + e₂) ≜ [e/x]e₁ + [e/x]e₂
    [e/x](e₁ × e₂) ≜ [e/x]e₁ × [e/x]e₂
    [e/x]b ≜ b
    [e/x](IF e₁ THEN e₂ ELSE e₃) ≜ IF [e/x]e₁ THEN [e/x]e₂ ELSE [e/x]e₃
    [e/x]y ≜ e  if  x=y
    [e/x]y ≜ y  if  x≠y
    [e/x](LET y = e₁ IN e₂) ≜ LET y = [e/x]e₁ IN e₂       if  x=y
    [e/x](LET y = e₁ IN e₂) ≜ LET y = [e/x]e₁ IN [e/x]e₂  if  x≠y

You need to implement `subst` in homework 3.

# Variable Capture

The definition of substituion assumes that the term being used as the
substitution of the variable is closed, i.e., it has no free variables.

This is to prevent "scope capture" issues, like the following:

    LET x = y + y IN
    LET y = 10 IN
    x + y
    ≈
    [y + y/x](LET y = 10 IN x + y) 
    ≠ 
    LET y = 10 IN (y + y) + y

The `y` in the substitution position was free before the substitution, and is
no longer free after. We will cover "capture-avoiding substitution" later in
this class. For now, we require that the expression being used for the
substitution is closed.

    [e₁/x]e₂
     ^  
     must be closed

# Functions

Let's add functions to the language. We will add a few new syntactic
categories:

    x ∈ param-var
    f ∈ fun-var
    e ∈ expr ⩴ …
             | x
             | LET x = e IN e
             -- new stuff
             | f(e,…,e)
    d ∈ defn ⩴ DEF f(x,…,x) = e
    p ∈ prog ⩴ d … d DO e

We now have two types of variables, and two types of scope:

    free-vars-param ∈ expr → ℘(param-var)
    free-vars-fun ∈ expr → ℘(fun-var)

Param vars are in scope if they are introduced by a `LET` or a function binder
(inside a definition), and function vars are in scope if they are introduced by
a function definition.

The meaning of a function is just like `LET`: via substitution. First, we need
to track an “environment” of function definitions:

    interp ∈ expr × list defn → answer
    interp(f(e₁,…,eₙ),[d₁,…,dₙ]) ≜ ([e₁/x₁]∘⋯∘[eₙ/xₙ])e
      where
        dᵢ = DEF f(x₁,…,xₙ) = e
</pre>

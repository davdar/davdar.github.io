# Final Project Options II

- Language-based Security
- Language-based Privacy
- Automatic Differentiation

## Language-based Security

Follow either of these papers (or both!):

1. [Volpano-Smith-Irvine](http://users.cis.fiu.edu/~smithg/papers/jcs96.pdf)
2. [Heintze-Riecke](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/andru/cs711/2003fa/reading/heintze98slam.pdf)

(1) is a core imperative language which enforces information flow security, and
(2) is a core functional language which enforces information flow security.
Handling imperative features and higher-order functions are both challenging
features when designing an information flow type system.

In (1), the typing rules are in Figure 5, and in (2) the typing rules are in
Table 3. (2) uses sub-typing, which is a technique also used in type safety for
object oriented programming languages. You can always *not* do subtyping by
replacing all occurences of ordering (`⊑`) with equality (`=`). If you *do* do
subtyping, note that a funny thing always happens on the left side of function
types.

## Language-based Privacy

Follow this paper:

1. [Reed-Pierce](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/papers/dp.pdf)

The typing rules are in Figure 2. In this paper, the type environment also
track sensitivities. In your type checking algorithm, you should take a normal
type environment as input (as seen in class), and return a sensitivity
environment as output, which maps variables to sensitivities (natural or real
numbers). A full description of this “type context as input—sensitivity context
as output” technique is described here:

2. [deAmorim-Gaboardi-GallegoArias-Hsu](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.04522.pdf)

## Automatic Differentiation

The wikipedia article on AD using dual numbers should be enough information for
you to write an AD interpreter:

1. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation#Automatic_differentiation_using_dual_numbers)

Also a good blog post which describes both forward mode and reveres mode is
here:

2. [Blog](http://www.columbia.edu/~ahd2125/post/2015/12/5/)

The description of forward mode can be followed to implement a non-standard
interpreter which computes derivatives. Work out a few simple examples by hand
first, and then try to get your interpreter to work on them only after you have
worked out examples. Your interpreter should return both values and derivatives
as results using dual numbers (described below):

The description of reverse mode in this blog post will not translate well to a
recursive-descent interpreter setting.

Start with a language that looks like this:

    x ∈ var
    r ∈ ℝ
    e ⩴ x | r | e + e | e × e | sin(e) | cos(e)

and then once you have forward mode working, add either more arithmetic
operators (easy):

    e ⩴ … | exp(e) | ln(e) | relu(e) | sigmoid(e)

let-binding (medium):

    e ⩴ … | LET x = e IN e

tuple and tagged union datatypes (medium):

    e ⩴ … | ⟨e,e⟩ | fst(e) | snd(e) | left(e) | right(e) | CASE(e){x⇒e}{x⇒e}

or higher-order functions (hard):

    e ⩴ … | FUN(x) ⇒ e | e(e)

You will want to set up your interpreter to use *dual number* instead of
numbers as value, and an environment which maps from variables to dual numbers:

    v ∈ value ≜ ℝ
    d ∈ derivative ≜ ℝ
    v̂ ∈ value^ ⩴ ⟨v,d⟩
    γ̂ ∈ env^ ≜ var ⇀ value^

To compute the derivative of an expression w.r.t. a variable, just include an
initial environment which has (1) values for all of the free variables, and (2)
derivatives of 1 for the variable you are deriving w.r.t., and derivatives of 0
for all other variables.

To do reverse mode: rather than represent dual numbers as a pair of a value `v`
with its derivative `d` (as in `⟨v,d⟩`), instead represent dual numbers as a
pair of a value `v` and a *function* `κ` which when given a derivative for the
parent, will compute the derivative of the current term. E.g., in forward mode,
times will look like this:


    v ∈ ℝ
    d ∈ ℝ
                  derivative       derivative
                  ⌄⌄               ⌄⌄⌄⌄⌄⌄⌄⌄⌄⌄⌄⌄⌄
    ⟨v₁,d₁⟩ ×̂ ⟨v₂,d₂⟩ ≜ ⟨v₁ × v₂ , d₁×v₂ + v₁×d₂⟩
    ^^^^^^     ^^        ^^^^^^^
    dual       value     value
    number

but in reverse mode will look like this:

    v ∈ ℝ
    d ∈ ℝ
    κ ∈ ℝ → ℝ
    ⟨v₁,κ₁⟩ ×̂ ⟨v₂,κ₂⟩ ≜ ⟨v₁ × v₂ , κ′⟩
      where κ′(d) = κ₁(d×v₂) + κ₂(v₁×d)

To do reverse mode for all variables at once (the gradient) you will need to
aggregate all derivatives from all expression leaves for all variables. To do
this, thread through an output parameter for the interpreter which carries the
derivative of all variables found, and combines the output of sub-terms to
compute the final gradient.

Forward mode example:

     derivative w.r.t. x
     |          initial environment: x = 10, y = 20 (derivative at this point)
     ⌄          ⌄⌄⌄⌄⌄⌄⌄⌄⌄⌄⌄
    Dₓ(sin(xy))({x↦10,y↦20})
       ^^^^^^^
       expression we are taking derivative of w.r.t. x
    = 
               value of x 
               |  derivative of x w.r.t. x
               |  |     value of y
               |  |     |  derivative of y w.r.t. x
               ⌄⌄ ⌄     ⌄⌄ ⌄
    interp({x↦⟨10,1⟩,y↦⟨20,0⟩},sin(xy))
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
           interpreter environment
    =
         value of `xy` at point x = 10, y = 20
         | derivative of `xy` w.r.t. x at point x = 10, y = 20
         ⌄ ⌄
    let ⟨v,d⟩ = interp({x↦⟨10,1⟩,y↦⟨20,0⟩},xy)
                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                recursive call

               derivative of `sin(xy)` w.r.t. x
               = Dₓ(sin(xy)) = cos(xy) × Dₓ(xy) = cos(v) × d
               ⌄⌄⌄⌄⌄⌄⌄⌄
    in ⟨sin(v),cos(v)×d⟩
        ^^^^^^
        value of `sin(xy)` at point x = 10, y = 20
        = sin(xy) = sin(v)

    = ⟨sin(200),cos(200)×20⟩
    = ⟨-0.34,-18.79⟩

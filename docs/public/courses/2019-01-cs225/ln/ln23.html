# Monads

- Name comes from category theory.
- Category theory is not needed to use monads.
- Monads are an API for re-programming a semicolon.
- Monads can make it easier to define “pure” functions.
- Case studies: interpreters.

## The Identity Monad

In this world, we are interested in programs that consume an `A` and output a
`B`.

    f : A ↣ B

The actual implementation of these programs are just functions

    f ∈ A → B

In order to compose two programs:

    f : A ↣ B
    g : B ↣ C
    _≫_ : A ↣ C

you need only compose the functions:

    f ∈ A → B
    g ∈ B → C
    _≫_ ∈ (A → B) × (B → C) → (A → C)
    (f ≫ g)(x) ≜ g(f(x))

## The Failure Monad

In this world, we are interested in programs that consume an `A` and output
`B`.

    f : A ↣ B

However we want to model the fact that programs could fail. To do this, the
implementation of these programs are functions which could return `BAD`.

    f ∈ A → B ⊎ {BAD}

Unlike the identity monad, `A ↣ B` is not a just function between `A` and
`B`–there is more structure to it.

In order to compose two programs:

    f : A ↣ B
    g : B ↣ C
    _≫_ : A ↣ C

we need a way of pipelining the failure of a function:

    f ∈ A → B ⊎ {BAD}
    g ∈ B → C ⊎ {BAD}
    _≫_ ∈ (A → B ⊎ {BAD}) × (B → C ⊎ {BAD}) → A → C ⊎ {BAD} 
    (f ≫ g)(x) ≜ g(f(x))  when  f(x) ≠ BAD
    …          ≜ BAD      when  f(x) = BAD

## The Environment Monad

In this world, we are interested in programs that consume an `A` and output
`B`.

    f : A ↣ B

However we want to model the fact that programs take an implicit environment as
input. To do this, the implementation of these programs are functions which
take an environment as a second argument.

    f ∈ A × Env → B

In order to compose two programs:

    f : A ↣ B
    g : B ↣ C
    _≫_ : A ↣ C

we need a way of pipelining the use of an environment

    f ∈ A × Env → B
    g ∈ B × Env → C
    _≫_ ∈ (A × Env → B) × (B × Env → C) → A × Env → C
    (f ≫ g)(x,γ) ≜ g(f(x,γ),γ)

## The State Monad

In this world, we are interested in programs that consume an `A` and output
`B`.

    f : A ↣ B

However we want to model the fact that programs transform take an implicit
state as input and output. To do this, the implementation of these programs are
functions which take a state as a second argument, and return a state as a
second output.

    f ∈ A × State → B × State

In order to compose two programs:

    f : A ↣ B
    g : B ↣ C
    _≫_ : A ↣ C

we need a way of pipelining the processing of state

    f ∈ A × State → B × State
    g ∈ B × State → C × State
    _≫_ ∈ (A × State → B × State) × (B × State → C × State) → A × State → C × State
    (f ≫ g)(x,σ) ≜
      let (y,σ′) = f(x,σ)
      in g(y,σ′)

## Programming with monads

Each of the above monads support composition of programs `A ↣ B`. The trick is
now to use a notation that “de-sugars” into use of the composition operator
`≫`. So programs that look like this:

    FUN (x) ⇒ 
      y = f(x) ;
      g(x,y)

turn into this:

    FUN (x) ⇒ 
      f(x) ≫ (FUN (y) ⇒ g(x,y))

Because `≫` changes meaning based on which monad you are using, this desugaring
of the semicolon likewise changes meaning based on the monad being used. Using
this desugaring, the “imperative-looking” program:

    FUN (x) ⇒ 
      y = f(x) ;
      g(x,y)

can be interpreted as a program which is either a pure function, one which
implicitly propagates failure, one which implicitly propagates an environment
context, or one which implicitly propagates state.

See the [LectureCode] [[HTML]] for these ideas instantiated to make our
implementation of interpreters simpler.

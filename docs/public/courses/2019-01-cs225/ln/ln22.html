# Semantics

Flavors of semantics:

- Definitional Interpreter:
    + This is the only flavor we have seen so far in class.
    + Pros/Cons:
        - ⊕ Simple
        - ⊕ *Very* suggestive of an algorithm
        - ⊖ Verbose notation
        - ⊖ Easy to get into “not-well-founded” situations
        - ⊖ Cannot easily model loops
        - ⊖ *Very* hard to prove things
        - ⊖ Function values are syntax
- Big-step Semantics:
    + Similar to definitional interpreters, but defined inductively as
      relations via inference rules.
    + Pros/Cons:
        - ⊕ Simple
        - ⊕ Suggestive of an algorithm
        - ⊕ Compact notation
        - ⊕ Well-founded by inductive interpretation of inference rules
        - ⊖ Cannot easily distinguish between stuck states and loops
        - ⊖ Hard to prove things
        - ⊖ Function values are syntax
- Small-step Semantics:
    + Also defined as inference rules, but only for reducible expressions + a
      definition for contexts.
    + Pros/Cons:
        - ⊕ Compact notation
        - ⊕ Well-founded by transitive closure interpretation of rules
        - ⊕ Can easily distinguish between stuck states and loops
        - ⊕ Makes proofs much easier
        - ⊖ Not simple
        - ⊖ Less suggestive of an algorithm
        - ⊖ Function values are syntax
- Denotation Semantics:
    + A definitional interpreter that has been patched up to avoid
      “not-well-founded” situations
    + Pros/Cons:
        - ⊕ Suggestive of an algorithm
        - ⊕ Well-founded by domain construction
        - ⊕ Can easily distinguish between stuck states and loops
        - ⊕ Function values are (continuous) mathematical functions
        - ⊖ *Very* complicated
        - ⊖ Verbose notation
        - ⊖ Hard to prove things

# Review: A Definitional Interpreter

    e ∈ expr ⩴ i | e+e | b | IF e THEN e ELSE e | x | LET x = e IN e 
    v ∈ val ⩴ i | b

    interp ∈ env × expr ⇀ val
    interp(γ,i) ≜ i
    interp(γ,e₁+e₂) ≜ i₁ + i₂
      where i₁ = interp(γ,e₁)
            i₂ = interp(γ,e₂)
    interp(γ,b) ≜ b
    interp(γ,IF e₁ THEN e₂ ELSE e₃) ≜ interp(γ,e₂)
      when interp(γ,e₁) = true
    interp(γ,IF e₁ THEN e₂ ELSE e₃) ≜ interp(γ,e₃)
      when interp(γ,e₁) = false
    interp(γ,x) = γ(x)
    interp(γ,LET x = e₁ IN e₂) ≜ interp(γ[x↦v],e₂)
      where v = interp(γ,e₁)

# Big-step Semantics

A big-step semantics looks a lot like a definitional interpreter, but using
funny notation. The notation is the same inference rule notation we saw from
type systems, and is interpreted in the same way. These rules should be read:
“If BLAH above the line is true, then BLOOP below the line is true.”

    ┌─────────┐
    │γ , e ⇓ v│
    └─────────┘

    ─────────(int)
    γ , i ⇓ i

    γ , e₁ ⇓ i₁
    γ , e₂ ⇓ i₂
    ───────────────────(plus)
    γ , e₁+e₂ ⇓ i₁ + i₂

    ─────────(bool)
    γ , b ⇓ b

    γ , e₁ ⇓ true
    γ , e₂ ⇓ v
    ─────────────────────────────(if─true)
    γ , IF e₁ THEN e₂ ELSE e₃ ⇓ v

    γ , e₁ ⇓ false
    γ , e₃ ⇓ v
    ─────────────────────────────(if─false)
    γ , IF e₁ THEN e₂ ELSE e₃ ⇓ v

    γ(x) = v
    ─────────(var)
    γ , x ⇓ v

    γ , e₁ ⇓ v₁
    γ[x↦v₂] , e₂ ⇓ v₂
    ─────────────────────────(let)
    γ , LET x = e₁ IN e₂ ⇓ v₂

A closed program has a meaning if there exists some `v` such that `∅ , e ⇓ v`.
Both looping programs and crashing programs do not have meaning. We could model
crashing programs explicitly, and then looping programs would be the only
programs that don't have meaning, but this is not usually done. (This
particular language doesn't have loops, but these would be the issues if the
language did have loops.)

What we have defined is a relation, and it is well defined whether or not a
particular expression and value `∅ , e ⇓ v` are in the relation. Although the
meaning of some expressions is undefined, the set of expressions with undefined
meaning is well defined–an important distinction!

When there is a store in the program, it gets threaded through in the same was
as the interpreter:

    ┌──────────────────┐
    │γ , σ , e ⇓ v , σ │
    └──────────────────┘

# Small-step Semantics

A small-step semantics uses inference rules, but looks a lot different than a
definitional interpreter or a big-step semantics. The idea is to describe
computation in the smallest steps possible, and then work with the transitive
closure (i.e., iterations) of these tiny steps.

To avoid having to carry around the environment all of the time, and to
simplify proofs, small-step semantics are usually written in
“substitution-style” instead of “environment-style”.

    
    ┌───────┐
    │ e ↝ e │
    └───────┘
       syntax plus
       |
    ---⌄-------------(plus)
    i₁ + i₂ ↝ i₁ + i₂
                 ^
                 math plus

    ----------------------------(if-true)
    IF true THEN e₁ ELSE e₂ ↝ e₁

    ----------------------------(if-false)
    IF false THEN e₁ ELSE e₂ ↝ e₁

    -----------------------(let)
    LET x = v in e ↝ [x/v]e

These are all small bits of computation. Each expressions which can take a step
is called a “redex”, which is short for “reducible expression”. The (plus) rule
doesn't apply until both arguments are literally integers (not arbitrary
sub-expressions), and likewise for all of the other rules. The idea is that
either the whole expression is literally a value (like `5`), or there should
always be a little bit of work to do somewhere inside the expression. E.g., in
this program:

    LET x = 1 + 1 IN x

The “little bit of work to do” is `1 + 1`. To formalize a “location” where this
work to be done lives, we define contexts `E`.

    E ∈ context ⩴ □ | E + e | v + E | IF E THEN e ELSE e | LET x = E IN e

The definition of `context` is created delicately to enforce that computation
must proceed first to the left of a plus node, and only after the left side has
been fully reduced to a value does evaluation proceed to the right of the plus.

Every expression is either a value or can be decomposed into an expression
context with a reducible expression inside:

    EITHER e = v     FOR SOME v
    OR     e = E[e′] AND e′ ↝ e″

The full evaluation of a term is the transitive closure of the small step
relation, written `↝⋆`. This many-small-step relation coincides with big-step
semantics when it fully reduces the term to a value.

    e ↝⋆ v  ⬄  e ⇓ v

However, looping terms are now defined as those which (1) can always take a
step, and (2) never step to a value. Crashing programs are those which step to
some term which is both not a value, and cannot take another step.

# Denotational Semantics

There are two key ideas behind denotational semantics, which are orthogonal (in
my opinion).

1. The introduction of fuel to a definitional interpreter in order for the
   definition to be well-founded.
2. The introduction of fuel to the definition of the set of values in order for
   the definition to be well-founded.

(1): Rather than a definitional interpreter that looks like this:

    env ∈ var ⇀ value
    interp ∈ env × expr ⇀ value

We instead add a “fuel” argument to the interpreter, and a special return value
`OOF` which stands for “out of fuel”:

    interp ∈ ℕ × env × expr ⇀ value ⊎ {OOF}

The interpreter first checks to see if there is fuel left. If there is no fuel
left, we return `OOF`:

    interp(0,γ,e) ≜ OOF

If there is fuel available we proceed with the usual definition, but with a
decremented fuel argument for recursive calls to the interpreter:

    interp(1+n,γ,e) ≜ … interp(n,_,_) … interp(n,_,_) …

This interpreter always terminates because the fuel is always decreasing and
eventually will reach `0` (or the interpreter will terminate before the fuel
runs out and return a value).

(2): The next issue is that we may want something more informative as the
representation of values. The representation of integers is a math integer, and
the representation of pairs is a Cartesian product between sets–why can't we
represent functions as a function space between sets? E.g., why not this
candidate definition:

    value ≜ ℤ ⨄ 𝔹 ⊎ (value → value)

This definition of a set is not well-founded–there is no “solution” to this set
equation over `value`.

The fix is to add fuel to the set of values, and build a hierarchy of function
spaces based on the fuel.

    value₀ ≜ {OOF}
    value₁ ≜ ℤ ⊎ 𝔹 ⊎ (value₀ ⇉ value₀ ⊎ {OOF})
    value₂ ≜ ℤ ⊎ 𝔹 ⊎ (value₁ ⇉ value₁ ⊎ {OOF})
    ⋮

We then construct a set which is the join of all of these sets:

    value∞ ≜ ⊔ₙ valueₙ

where the lattice is defined in terms of “defined-ness”, i.e., how often
something returns non-`OOF` results.

This set *is* well-founded, and allows a definition of an interpreter that
returns this set of values. We write a double-right arrow `⇉` to denote a
*continuous* function space. Continuity here just means that if a function
returns something other than `OOF` on one input, then considering a
more-defined input will also not result in `oof`. (more defined inputs give
more defined outputs.)

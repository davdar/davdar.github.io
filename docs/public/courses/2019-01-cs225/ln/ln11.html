# Review

Last time we spent all of class time reviewing solutions to homework 4. The
class before that we discussed adding functions to the language. Instead of
wring programs like this:

    DEF f(x,y) = x + y
    DEF g(x,y) = x * y
    DO f(g(2,2),g(3,3)) -- 2²+3²
    ≈
    f(4,9)
    ≈
    13

where function definitions are special top-level syntax, we are now writing
the above program like this:

    LET f = FUN (x,y) ⇒ x + y IN
    LET g = FUN (x,y) ⇒ x * y IN
    f(g(2,2),g(3,3))

The motivation for this change is to allow function definition to take place in
any sub-expression. This induced a new discussion about scope:

    LET y = 1 IN
    LET f = FUN (x) ⇒ x + y IN
    f(2)

(does the `y` inside `f` see the let binding above?)

as well as the following design as the value representation of functions,
called a *closure*:

    γ ∈ env ≜ var ⇀ val
    v ∈ value ⩴ i | b | ⟨ FUN (x,…,x) ⇒ e , γ ⟩

Note that:

1. `value` and `env` are defined *mutually recursively*
2. The value representation for functions records the environment `γ` that was
   present *at function creation time*. These are the delayed substitutions
   that should have been carried out in the body of the function if we were
   following a substitution semantics.

Also, note that because functions are “first class expressions”, this means
that closures are “first class values”.

    LET f = FUN(x) ⇒
      LET y = x * x IN
      LET g = FUN (z) ⇒
        y + z
      IN
    IN
    LET h = f(2) IN
    h(3)

    ≈

    (FUN(x) ⇒ FUN (z) ⇒ (x * x) + z)(2)(3)
    ≈
    (FUN(x,z) ⇒ x*x + z)(2,3)

Functions can return functions!
            
# Mutation

We will now turn out attention to these types of programs:

    x = 1;
    y = x + 2;
    x = 3;
    z = x + 2;
    return y + z;

You are probably used to thinking about this program as:

1. a “box” for each of the variables `x`, `y` and `z`.
2. each statement changes the boxes
3. `return` is a special command that says “this is the result”

We are going to study this program in a more explicit form:

    LET x = box 1 IN
    LET y = box (!x + 2) IN
    LET _ = x ← 3 IN
    LET z = box (!x + 2) IN
    !y + !z

there are three and a half new syntactic forms features at work here:

- (1) `box e` creates a new box where the initial contents is the value resulting
   in evaluating `e`.
- (2) `!e` returns the value that currently lives inside the box that `e`
   evaluates to.
- (3) `e₁ ← e₂` takes the box that is returned by `e₁` and updates its value to be
   result of evaluating `e₂`.
- (3½) `LET _ = e₁ IN e₂` means “perform the actions in `e₁` and discard the
   result”. This is how we represent general program fragments `e₁ ; e₂` when
   `e₁` isn't introducing a new variable.

Notice that we are being very precise about three distinct, orthogonal concepts:

1. The *variables* `x`, `y` and `z`.
2. The *values* `1`, `2` and  `3`.
3. The *boxes* that (a) each variable is bound to, and (b) the value inside of
   each box. *Both (a) and (b) never change.* It is the contents of each box
   that changes.

Also notice that the syntax for assignment is `e₁ ← e₂`. *assignment is
unrelated from variable scope; assignment is about boxes, which are runtime
values, and `e₁` here is not a variable name, but an expression that evaluates
to a box*.

A special power of programming with boxes is the ability to *alias* boxes.

    LET x = box 1 IN
    LET y = x IN
    LET _ = y ← 4 IN
    !x

This program evaluates to 4 in the following steps: it creates a new box with 1
inside it, introduces a *new name* (y) for the *same box* (the one with 1
inside), updates the box through the new name, and then dereferences the box
through the old name. This is analogous to the following C program:

    int *x;
    x = malloc(1 * sizeof(int));
    *x = 1;
    int *y;
    y = x;
    *y = 4
    return *x;

Let's get formal about the syntax of our language:

    e ∈ expr ⩴ i | e+e | e×e 
             | b | IF e THEN e ELSE e 
             | x | LET x = e IN e
             | FUN (x,…x) ⇒ e | e(e,…,e)
             -- new stuff
             | BOX e
             | !e
             | e ← e

    v ∈ value ⩴ i | b | ⟨ FUN (x,…,x) ⇒ e , γ ⟩ | l
    l ∈ location ≜ ℕ

    γ ∈ env ≜ var ⇀ value
    σ ∈ store ≜ location ⇀ value

    a ∈ answer ⩴ ⟨v,σ⟩ | BAD

`location` values are the runtime representation of a box. The location `l` is
a unique identifier for a particular box. Creating a new box always generates a
fresh, unique identifier.

Note that values contain environments (in the case of closures), but *do not*
contain stores.

The store is a manifestation of “all of the boxes in the program execution, and
what they point to”

The shape of the interpreter is now:

    interp ∈ env × store × expr → answer

The idea is that the environment represents the static, *lexical* context of
the program, along with the runtime values mapped to lexical variables. The
environment *doesn't* change during execution, however, it may *grow* as we
introduce new variables into scope.

The store represents the *dynamic* context of the program, along with runtime
values mapped to dynamically allocated locations (boxes). The store *does*
change during execution, both by updating existing mappings from locations to
values, to allocating new, fresh mappings from locations to values.

## The new interpreter

We have two problems to solve in defining an interpreter for this new language:

1. how to interpret new language features (box, dereference, assign)
2. how to interpret existing language features in the presence of the new ones

What does this program mean?

    LET x = BOX(1) IN
    ((x ← 2) + (x ← 3)) + !x

We are going to:

1. fix a *left-to-right* evaluation order, and
2. decide (somewhat arbitrarily) that the result of an assignment is the value
   that was produce by the right-hand-side.

This program then evaluates as:

    LET x = BOX(1) IN
    ((x ← 2) + (x ← 3)) + !x
    ≈
    γ = {x    ↦ BOX(1000)}
    σ = {1000 ↦ 1}
    ((x ← 2) + (x ← 3)) + !x
    ≈
    γ = {x    ↦ BOX(1000)}
    σ = {1000 ↦ 2}
    (2 + (x ← 3)) + !x
    ≈
    γ = {x    ↦ BOX(1000)}
    σ = {1000 ↦ 3}
    (2 + 3) + !x
    ≈
    γ = {x    ↦ BOX(1000)}
    σ = {1000 ↦ 3}
    (2 + 3) + 3
    ≈
    8

The consequence of this is that interpretation of `+` must (1) *propagate* the
side-effects that occur in sub-expressions, and (2) do so in left-to-right
order.

Interpretation of plus looks like so:

    interp(γ,σ,e₁ + e₂) ≜ ⟨i₁+i₂,σ″⟩
      where ⟨i₁,σ′⟩ = interp(γ,σ,e₁)
      and   ⟨i₂,σ″⟩ = interp(γ,σ′,e₂)

Interpretation of new language features looks like so:

    interp(γ,σ,BOX(e)) ≜ ⟨BOX(l),σ′[l ↦ v]⟩
      where ⟨v,σ′⟩ = interp(γ,σ,e)
            l = fresh(σ′)

    interp(γ,σ,!e) ≜ ⟨σ′(l),σ′⟩
      where ⟨BOX(l),σ′⟩ = interp(γ,σ,e)

    interp(γ,σ,e₁ ← e₂) ≜ ⟨v,σ″[ℓ ↦ v]⟩
      where ⟨BOX(l),σ′⟩ = interp(γ,σ,e)
            ⟨v,σ″⟩      = interp(γ,σ′,e₂)

## Exercise:

1. write in math the definition of interpretation for `IF`.

# Announcements

Two seminars next week:

- Tuesday, 12–1, John Dewey Memorial Lounge, Old Mill
  + 0.5% extra credit
  + free food
- Thursday, 12–1, Perkins 101
  + 0.5% extra credit
  + unsure about food situation

See Piazza for details.

# Review

- Variables and scope
  + draw a box around every variable binder
  + draw an arrow from every variable sub-expression to its binder
  + draw a circle around every free variable
  + what are the free variables of the expression? (all the ones you circled)
  + is the expression closed? (are there no circled variables?) 

- Substitution
  + interpret let expressions as substitution, and show each step of the
    interpretation

Examples:

    e₁ = (LET x = 2 + 2 IN x + x) + 1
    
    e₂ = LET x = 1 IN
         LET y = x IN
         LET x = z IN
         x + y + z
    
    e₃ = IF (LET x = true IN x) THEN x ELSE y


# Environments

Currently we have an understanding of variables and let-binding as follows:

1. free variables have no meaning
2. let expressions are given meaning via substitution (along with the variable
   it binds)

Substitution is a fine tool for understanding the *meaning* of programs, but
leads to an inefficient implementation. Consider this expression:

    LET x = 1 + 1 + 1 IN
    x + x + x

Currently, we perform substitution to get:

    (1 + 1 + 1) + (1 + 1 + 1) + (1 + 1 + 1)

which is undesirable for two reasons:

1. Substitution requires traversing the whole program, which is inefficient.
2. Substitution requires a syntactic representation of the computation, which
   isn't true for some interpreters (like compilers)

A better approach is a *lazy* implementation of substitution. The idea is to
remember what variables should be replaced with from a substitution, but don't
actually do the substitution until the *interpreter* encounters the variable.
This “lazy substitution” object is called an environment, which we will write
as `γ`, and maps variables directly to values.

Interpreting the above example in this way gives:

          ╭                                   ╮
          │ {}           LET x = 1 + 1 + 1 IN │
    interp│          ,   x + x + x            ╯
          ╰              
    =       γ^          e^               
          ╭                                   ╮
    interp│ {x ↦ 3}  ,   x + x + x            │
          ╰                                   ╯

    = interp({x↦3},x) + interp({x↦3},x) + interp({x↦3},x)

    = 3 + 3 + 3

    = 9

Remember, we have only changed the implementation of the interpreter, the
meaning of programs has not changed!

# Functions

Let's add functions to the language. We will add a few new syntactic
categories:

    x ∈ var
    f ∈ fun-name
    e ∈ expr ⩴ …
             | x
             | LET x = e IN e
             -- new stuff
             | f(e,…,e)
    d ∈ defn ⩴ DEF f(x,…,x) = e
    p ∈ prog ⩴ d … d DO e

We now have two types of variables, and two types of scope:

    free-vars ∈ expr → ℘(var)
    free-fun-names ∈ expr → ℘(fun-name)

Vars are in scope if they are introduced by a `LET` or a function binder
(inside a definition), and function vars are in scope if they are introduced by
a function definition.

The meaning of a function is just like `LET`: via substitution. First, we need
to track an “environment” of function definitions. In substitution style this
would look like:

    interp ∈ list(defn) × expr → answer
    interp([d₁,…,dₙ],f(e₁,…,eₙ)) ≜ interp(([e₁/x₁]∘⋯∘[eₙ/xₙ])e)
      where
        `DEF f(x₁,…,xₙ) = e` ∈ [d₁,…,dₙ]

Now that we are using an environment, the interpretation of functions is:

    interp ∈ list(defn) × env × expr → answer
    interp([d₁,…,dₙ],γ,f(e₁,…,eₙ)) ≜ interp(ds,γ[x₁↦v₁]⋯[xₙ↦vₙ],e)  
      where  `DEF f(x₁,…xₙ) = e` = ds(f)
      and    vᵢ = interp(ds,γ,eᵢ)

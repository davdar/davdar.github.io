# Formal Semantics for Objects

We will now design an interpreter for the extended language with objects. This
interpreter has the same environment and store as before. The first observation
is that we don't need any new components to the interpreter; we just need new
syntactic forms, and new values. Even better, the interpretation of all other
language features (arithmetic, let, functions, mutation, etc.) are completely
unchanged. This is good news! So in designing the interpreter, we will only
show cases for new syntax. Here is the interpreter:

    ⟦_⟧ ∈ expr → env × store → maybe(value × store)
    ⟦class fields x₁ … xₙ [method x′₁ => e₁] … [method x′ₘ => eₘ] end⟧(γ,σ) ≜ (v,σ)
      where
      v = ⟨class fields x₁ … xₙ [method x′₁ => e₁] … [method x′ₘ => eₘ] end, γ⟩
    ⟦new e { x₁ = e₁ , … , xₙ = eₙ }⟧(γ,σ) ≜ (v′,σ′)
      where
        (v, σ₀) = ⟦e⟧(γ,σ)
        v = ⟨class fields y₁ … yₙ [method y′₁ => e′₁] … [method y′ₘ => e′ₘ] end, γ′⟩
        {x₁,…,xₙ} = {y₁,…,yₙ}
        (v₁,σ₁) = ⟦e₁⟧(γ,σ₀)
                ⋮
        (vₙ,σₙ) = ⟦eₙ⟧(γ,σₙ₋₁)
        {ℓ₁,…,ℓₙ} ∩ dom(σₙ) = ∅
        ℓᵢ ≠ ℓⱼ for i ≠ j
        v′ = ⟨object fields {x₁ ↦ ℓ₁ , … , xₙ ↦ ℓₙ} methods {y′₁ ↦ e′₁ , … , y′ₘ ↦ e′ₘ }, γ′⟩
        σ′ = σₙ[ℓ₁↦v₁,…,ℓₙ↦vₙ]
    ⟦e.x⟧(γ,σ) ≜ (loc ℓᵢ,σ′)
      where
        (v, σ′)
        v = ⟨object fields {x₁ ↦ ℓ₁ , … , xₙ ↦ ℓₙ} methods {x′₁ ↦ e₁ , … , x′ₘ ↦ eₘ}, γ′⟩
        x = xᵢ
    ⟦e.x⟧(γ,σ) ≜ ⟦eᵢ⟧(γ′[self↦v],σ′)
      where
        (v, σ′)
        v = ⟨object fields {x₁ ↦ ℓ₁ , … , xₙ ↦ ℓₙ} methods {x′₁ ↦ e₁ , … , x′ₘ ↦ eₘ}, γ′⟩
        x ∉ {x₁,…,xₙ]
        x = x′ᵢ

There is a lot of new and compact notation going on here, but it's not as
complicated as it first looks.

First, let's focus on the class creation syntax:

    ⟦class fields x₁ … xₙ [method x′₁ => e₁] … [method x′ₘ => eₘ] end⟧(γ,σ) ≜ (v,σ)
      where
      v = ⟨class fields x₁ … xₙ [method x′₁ => e₁] … [method x′ₘ => eₘ] end, γ⟩

This is the interpretation rule for creating a new class. Here, the *class
value* is just a copy of the *class expression*, but with a copy of the current
environment `γ`. So the `γ` is part of the class value, whereas `σ` is the
“next” state the interpreter should use. Because we aren't creating any new
locations, and we aren't changing the values associated with any locations, we
leave the store alone and return `σ` unchanged.

Next let's look at object creation `new e { x = e , … , c = e }`:

    ⟦new e { x₁ = e₁ , … , xₙ = eₙ }⟧(γ,σ) ≜ (v′,σ′)
      where
        (v, σ₀) = ⟦e⟧(γ,σ)
        v = ⟨class fields y₁ … yₙ [method y′₁ => e′₁] … [method y′ₘ => e′ₘ] end, γ′⟩
        {x₁,…,xₙ} = {y₁,…,yₙ}
        (v₁,σ₁) = ⟦e₁⟧(γ,σ₀)
                ⋮
        (vₙ,σₙ) = ⟦eₙ⟧(γ,σₙ₋₁)
        {ℓ₁,…,ℓₙ} ∩ dom(σₙ) = ∅
        ℓᵢ ≠ ℓⱼ for i ≠ j
        v′ = ⟨object fields {x₁ ↦ ℓ₁ , … , xₙ ↦ ℓₙ} methods {y′₁ ↦ e′₁ , … , y′ₘ ↦ e′ₘ }, γ′⟩
        σ′ = σₙ[ℓ₁↦v₁,…,ℓₙ↦vₙ]

Let's work “bottom up”, so the last thing we will understand is the result
`(v′,σ′)`. 

First, the expression `e` is evaluated in the current environment `γ` and the
initial store `σ`. This returns a value `v` which we match to be a class value,
and an updated store `σ₀`. (In the example `new Point { … }`, `Point` is a
variable which is mapped to a class value in the environment.)

Next is the equality `{x₁,…,xₙ} = {y₁,…,yₙ}`. This equality means that each
sequence `x₁ … xₙ` and `y₁ … yₙ`, when interpreted as sets, are equal. That is,
they have to have the same elements, but the order of the elements can be
different. This is just a check, and you will implement this check in HW08 as
E1.

Next is the sequence of equalities `(v₁,σₙ) = ⟦e₁⟧(γ,σ₀) … (vₙ,σₙ) =
⟦eₙ⟧(γ,σₙ₋₁)`. This means to first interpret `e₁` in the current environment
`γ` and `σ₀`, the store that came back as a result of interpreting `e`, then to
interpret `e₂` in the current environment `γ` and `σ₁`, the store that came
back as a result of interpreting `e₁`, and so on up to `eₙ`. Your solution to
E2 in HW08 will encode this logic.

The next two conditions are `{ℓ₁,…,ℓₙ} ∩ dom(σ₀) = ∅` and `ℓᵢ ≠ ℓⱼ for i ≠ j`.
Together these mean “generate `n` fresh locations”. The first condition ensures
that the locations are not currently in the store (if one of them was in the
store already, the intersection would be non-empty), and the second condition
says that all of the new fresh locations need to be different from each other.
You will implement this also as part of E2, and you will use the
`freshLocation` utility function to generate individual fresh locations (which
was part of HW07, but is provided to you in HW08).

The second-to-last condition is `v′ = ⟨object fields …, γ′⟩`. This is
constructing the final object value that will be returned as the resulting
value for interpreting the expression. The fields are all initialized to the
fresh locations generated in the previous conditions, and the methods are all
just copies of the methods from the class value (but in Haskell, now
represented as a map instead of as a list of tuples). Finally, the closure
environment for the object creation is the same closure environment that was
contained in the class value. We want methods to see values for free variables
that were around during class creation time, because that's syntactically where
the methods first appeared.

Finally, the last condition `σ′ = σₙ[ℓ₁↦v₁,…,ℓₙ↦vₙ]` defines the final
resulting store to be the last store that was returned from evaluating `eₙ`
extended with new mappings, from each of the fresh locations generated for the
fields `ℓ₁ … ℓₙ` to each of the values returned from evaluating initial field
value expressions `e₁ … eₙ`. Each field value is now mapped to a location in
the final value, and those locations map to initial field values in the final
store. This final store is set up in your solution to E2, but the final object
value is created in your solution to E3.

Finally, there is field/method access:

    ⟦e.x⟧(γ,σ) ≜ (loc ℓᵢ,σ′)
      where
        (v, σ′) = ⟦e⟧(γ,σ)
        v = ⟨object fields {x₁ ↦ ℓ₁ , … , xₙ ↦ ℓₙ} methods {x′₁ ↦ e₁ , … , x′ₘ ↦ eₘ}, γ′⟩
        x = xᵢ
    ⟦e.x⟧(γ,σ) ≜ ⟦eᵢ⟧(γ′[self↦v],σ′)
      where
        (v, σ′) = ⟦e⟧(γ,σ)
        v = ⟨object fields {x₁ ↦ ℓ₁ , … , xₙ ↦ ℓₙ} methods {x′₁ ↦ e₁ , … , x′ₘ ↦ eₘ}, γ′⟩
        x ∉ {x₁,…,xₙ}
        x = x′ᵢ

There are two cases for field access: when the accessed name `x` corresponds to
a field of the object, and when it corresponds to a method of the object. In
both cases, the expression `e` is evaluated and an object value is expected to
come back. The constraint `x = xᵢ` in the first case encodes the case where
the field name `x` corresponds to an object field name, and the constraints `x
∉ {x₁,…,xₙ}` and `x = x′ᵢ` in the second case encodes the case where the
field both doesn't correspond to a field name, and does correspond to a method
name. In the first case, the location `ℓᵢ` which corresponds to the field name
`xᵢ` is returned as the final value .along with the new store, resulting from
evaluating `e`. In the second case we evaluate the method body `eᵢ` associated
with the method name `xᵢ`. We evaluate this method body in the *closure
environment* `γ′` (the environment that existed when the class value was
created), and we add a new binding for the special variable `self`, mapping
back to the object.

# Course Technical Introduction

## Context w.r.t. Models of Computation

- First(ish) model of computation: Turing Machines (TM) (Turing, 1936)
  - First model for what an algorithm (1) *is*, (2) *is capable of* and (3) *is
    not capable of*.
  - Low level, intuitive abstraction for a “machine”
  - “Transition rules” as (not great) abstraction for code
  - “Infinite tape” as (good) abstraction for memory
  - “Rule application” as (mixed) abstraction for program execution
  - Not a programming language
  - More related to language recognition and hierarchies (e.g., regular,
    context-free languages)

E.g.:

    ⟨Q,Γ,b,Σ,δ,q₀,F⟩
    Q ≜ {1,2,3}           -- states
    F ≜ {'a','b',' '}     -- tape alphabet
    b ≜ ' '               -- blank symbol
    Σ ≜ {'a','b'}         -- input alphabet
    q₀ ≜ 1                -- initial state
    F ≜ {2,3}             -- halting states
    δ(1,'a') ≜ (' ',2,R)  -- transition rule
    δ(1,'b') ≜ (' ',3,R)  -- transition rule

- Second(ish) model of computation: Lambda Calculus (LC) (Church, 1936)
  - Church and Turing were buds
  - Simpler than TMs
  - Direct connections with formal logic
  - Hoped to also provide foundation for mathematics
  - “Symbolic expression” as (good) abstraction for code
  - “Size of symbolic expression” as (not great) abstraction for memory
  - “Substitution” as (mixed) abstraction for program execution
  - Basis for understanding programming language features
  - Basis for design of all functional programming languages

E.g.:

    λx.x      -- conditional
    λx.λy.x   -- true
    λx.λy.y   -- false

*Early programming languages looked more like Turing Machines, modern
programming languages look more like lambda calculus.* (Although, hardware
still looks closer to turing machines.) They were invented around the same
time...

*Running theme in this course: Most “new” ideas in programming language design
are actually quite old.*

TM and LC were developed to study what computer programs are capable of. For
example, there is Turing's famous halting problem which states:

> There does not exist a turing machine M that takes as input another turing
> machine N, and eventually halts with one output bit which is true iff N
> halts, and false iff N does not halt.

I.e., the “halting problem” is undecidable.

## Programming Language Semantics

What does this program mean? (APL, 1966)

    ↑+.×/N/⊂2 2⍴1 1 1 0

*Obviously* this is the Fibonacci sequence. How do we *show* this is the case?
We need a semantics for APL, and a description of the Fibonacci sequence in
that semantic domain. Here's what this looks like abstractly.

(examples taken from: http://microapl.com/APL/getting_started_chapter1.html)

    APL-term ∈ set

    e.g., 
      1 ∈ APL-term             -- evaluates to 1
      1+1 ∈ APL-term           -- evaluates to 2
      1+1 2 3 ∈ APL-term       -- evaluates to 2 3 4
      1 2+3 4 5 ∈? APL-term    -- error (syntax error or evaluation error?)
      3×3-1 ∈ APL-term         -- evaluates to 6
      2 3 1+8÷2 2 2 ∈ APL-term -- evaluates to 6 7 5

Now that we have a (mathematical) set of APL-terms, let's define a
(mathematical) set for results of APL expressions:

    ℝ ∈ set
    ℝ* ∈ set

    APL-result ∈ set
    APL-result ≜ ℝ*

What does `ℝ*` mean?

    ℝ¹ ≜ ℝ
    ℝ² ≜ ℝ × ℝ 
       = {⟨x,y⟩ | x ∈ ℝ, y ∈ ℝ}
    ℝ³ ≜ ℝ × ℝ × ℝ
    ℝ* ≜ ∃n∈ℕ. ℝⁿ
    APL-result ≜ ℝ*

The notation is precise (good) but more intimidating than necessary. `ℝ*` is
just a list of real numbers. In java, you might use the type `double[]` or
`ArrayList<Double>`.

Programming languages are given meaning through an *interpretation* function,
written with funny brackets called “Oxford brackets”:

    ⟦_⟧ ∈ APL-term ⇀ APL-result

Note the funny arrow, also called an "arrow hook". This arrow means a partial
function. Think of it for now as a function which returns a result on some
inputs, and crashes on others.

*Aside:* We often standardize on metavariables to implicitly always live in a
particular set. We will use the following implicit metavariables:

    r ∈ ℝ
    e ∈ APL-term

The set `APL-term` is defined as an inductively defined set:

    r₁ … rₙ ∈ APL-term      -- r₁ ‥ rₙ IS AN APL-term

    e₁ ∈ APL-term           -- IF e₁ IS AN APL-term
    e₂ ∈ APL-term           -- AND e₂ IS AN APL-term
    ----------------------  --
    e₁ + e₂ ∈ APL-term      -- THEN e₁ + e₂ IS AN APL-term

    e ∈ APL-term            -- IF e IS AN APL-term
    ----------------        --
    r × e ∈ APL-term        -- THEN r × e IS AN APL-term

which is often abbreviated as:

    e ∈ APL-term ⩴ r … r | e + e | r × e

This structured definition of programming language *syntax* is called a "BNF"
grammar, which means either “Backus-Naur Form” (famously formerly “Backus
Normal Form”).

The interpretation function is defined by induction on the syntax.

    ⟦r₁ … rₙ⟧ ≜ ⟨r₁,…,rₙ⟩ ∈ ℝⁿ ⊆ ℝ*
    ⟦e₁ + e₂⟧ ≜ ⟨r₁+s₁,…,rₙ+sₙ⟩ ∈ ℝⁿ ⊆ ℝ*
      where
        ⟨r₁,…,rₙ⟩ = ⟦e₁⟧ ∈ ℝⁿ
        ⟨s₁,…,sₙ⟩ = ⟦e₂⟧ ∈ ℝⁿ
    ⟦r × e⟧ ≜ ⟨r×s₁,…,r×sₙ⟩ ∈ ℝⁿ ⊆ ℝ*
      where
        ⟨s₁,…,sₙ⟩ = ⟦e⟧ ∈ ℝⁿ

Note that this definition is partial because `⟦e₁ + e₂⟧` requires the meaning
of both `e₁` and `e₂` to have the same dimension. This is why the set that
`⟦_⟧` lives in was written with a `⇀` and not `→`—to indicate this
“partiality”.

Moving to a slightly more abstract description:

*A “language” `ℒ` is some inductively defined set of sequences of symbols,
where each symbol has finite length.*

*A “denotation” `𝒟` is some well-defined mathematical set.*

*A “denotational semantics” is (usually) a function `⟦_⟧ ∈ ℒ → 𝒟` which gives mathematical
meaning to language terms.*

*An “interpreter” is (for our current purposes) a denotational semantics
implemented as a program you can run.

*Aside:* What happened to the partiality of `⟦_⟧`, i.e., the partial arrow
“`⇀`”? Partiality is easy to disguise as totality by extending a set with a
distinguished element `⊥`. Formally, this equivalence is written `A ⇀ B = A → B
⊎ {⊥}`. The operator `⊎` is pronounced “disjoint union” and `{⊥}` is a
singleton set. `B ⊎ {⊥}` means “a set that is just like B, but contains exactly
one new element `⊥`, which is guaranteed to be different than all elements of
`B`.”

Why are we doing this? Consider these two APL programs:

    e₁ ≜ 3 4+3 4

    e₂ ≜ 2×3 4

These are *different programs*, that is, `e₁ ≠ e₂`, however, they are
*equivalent programs*, i.e., they have the same meaning, which is shown by
`⟦e₁⟧ = ⟦e₂⟧`.

The value of this approach is we can extend our notion of equivalence to
programs with variables:

    e₁ ≜ a b+a b
    e₂ ≜ 2×a b
  
These *programs fragments* are also equivalent, even thought they are not
“complete programs” (i.e., they have “free variables”).

*Aside:* what's a compiler? A compiler is (1) another language `𝒞` which is
typically a much lower level of abstraction, and suitable for execution on
hardware (e.g., assembly code), (2) a semantics for `𝒞` as `⟦_⟧ ∈ 𝒞 → 𝒟`, and
(3) a function `compile ∈ ℒ → 𝒞` which preserves the meaning of programs, that
is, `⟦compile(e)⟧ = ⟦e⟧`.

           ⟦⋅⟧
    e --------------→ d₁
    |                 ‖
    |compile          ‖
    ↓                 ‖
    c --------------→ d₂
           ⟦⋅⟧

An important achievement in the field of programming languages is the design of
correct compilers, which are proven correct on paper, and more recently, proven
correct using computer-checked proofs. For any of this to work, compiler
designers need to be precise about modeling programming languages and their
semantics.

## Course Structure

The first 1/2 of the course will follow a pattern:

1. Start with the smallest language we can think of: `ℒ`
2. Design a domain `𝒟` in which we will give meaning to the language
3. Implement and interpreter for this language in Haskell (`⟦_⟧ ∈ ℒ → 𝒟`)
4. Extend the language with one new programming language feature
5. GOTO 2

Along the way we will discuss how these features appear in mainstream
languages, which languages got the feature right, and which languages got the
feature wrong.

## Language Features

-   Variables and Binding (substitution and environments)

        let x = 1 in
        let y = 2 in
        x + y

        let x = 1 in
        x + y

        let x = 1 in
        let x = 2 in
        x + x

-   Functions (closures)

        let f = fun x ⇒ x + x in …

        let x = 2 in
        let f = fun y ⇒ y * x in …

-   Mutation (indirection and stores)

        let x = box 1 in
        x ← 2 ;
        !x

    At this point in the class, we have:

        ⟦_⟧ ∈ exp → env × store ⇀ store × value

- Core OO (self reference, records)
- Inheritance (dynamic dispatch)
- Types (type checking, inference, soundness)
- Program Analysis (finding bugs, proving absence of bugs)
- Approaches to Semantics (big-step, small-step, denotational, interpreters)
- Effects (monads)
- Verification (dependent types)

Interesting linguistic features not covered:

- Relational programming
- Parallel programming
- Concurrent programming
- Distributed programming

…although, if your language has good support for monads, one can usually embed
these linguistic concepts in a monadic API; “there's a monad for that”.

[08 - Variables ⅋ Scope](#title)

# Playing with Scope

Python:

    x
    def f(x): return x
    f(1)
    x
    for x in [1,2,3]: y = x
    y
    x
    a = 100
    for a in [1,2,3]: b = 1
    a
    [ x for x in [1,2,3] ]
    x

Javascript:

    x
    function f(x) { return x; }
    f(1)
    x
    xs = [1,2,3]
    for (i in xs) { y = xs[i]; }
    y
    i
    a = 100
    for (a in [1,2,3]) { b = 1; }
    a

Haskell:

    x
    let f x = x
    f 1
    x
    [ x | x <- [1,2,3] ]
    x

# Variables and Scope

Let's add variables to our language. In addition to variables, we are going to
allow for the ability to give local names to intermediate computations.

    x ∈ variable-name ≜ symbol
    e ∈ expr ⩴ i
             | e + e
             | e * e
             -- NEW
             | x
             | let x = e in e

The idea behind “let” is it lets you reuse the result of a computation by name,
and the idea behind a variable is it lets you access these stored results.

## Well Formed Programs

We have our first syntactic notion of well-formedness. The main ideas are that
(1) a variable is only meaningful if it is in scope and (2) it is possible to
determine whether or not a given variable will be in scope by looking at the
program (i.e., you don't have to run it).

Let's look at some programs:

    let x = 1 + 1 in x
    let x = 1 + 1 in y
    let x = y in x
    let y = 1 + 1 in let x = y in x
    x

Some terminology:

- **variable reference**: the use of a variable
- **variable binder**: the place where a variable is bound by name
- **binder scope**: the part of the term in which a binder is “in scope”
- **free variable**: variables which occur in a term which are not “in scope”
- **open term**: a term with at least one free variable
- **closed term**: a term with no free variables

Let's look back at our examples and (1) draw a circle around every **binder**,
(2) draw a bracket for the **scope** of each variable, (3) draw an arrow from
every variable **reference** to the **binder** that it references, (4) draw a
square around every **free variable**, and (5) classify the term as open or
closed.

A program is “well formed” if all variables in the expression are in scope.
Let's try to write well-formed as a recursive predicate.

    WF ∈ expr → 𝔹
    WF(i) ≜ true
    WF(e₁ + e₂) ≜ WF(e₁) ∧ WF(e₂)
      ⋮
    WF(x) ≜ ??
    WF(LET x = e₁ IN e₂) ≜ WF(e₁) ∧ WF(e₂)

There is not enough information in our recursive definition. What we need is to
(1) collect variables which are “in scope”, and then (2) make sure all
variables are “in scope”.

Here is the well-formedness check:

    WF ∈ ℘(var) × expr → 𝔹
    WF(S,i) ≜ true
    WF(S,e₁ + e₂) ≜ WF(S,e₁) ∧ WF(S,e₂)
    WF(S,e₁ × e₂) ≜ WF(S,e₁) ∧ WF(S,e₂)
    WF(S,x) ≜ x ∈ S
    WF(S,LET x = e₁ IN e₂) ≜ WF(S,e₁) ∧ WF(S ∪ {x},e₂)

An alternative computation is to compute the “free variables” of a term. When
there are no free variables, the term is well-formed:

    FV ∈ expr → ℘(var)
    FV(i) ≜ ∅
    FV(e₁ + e₂) ≜ FV(e₁) ∪ FV(e₂)
    FV(e₁ × e₂) ≜ FV(e₁) ∪ FV(e₂)
    FV(x) ≜ {x}
    FV(LET x = e₁ IN e₂) = FV(e₁) ∪ (FV(e₂) ∖ {x})

You need to implement `FV` in homework 4 for a language that includes if
statements.

`WF` and `FV` are related by the following subset relationship:

    WF(S,e) ⟺ FV(e) ⊆ S

It is always true that:

    WF(FV(e),e)

and:

    closed(e) ⟺ WF(∅,e) ⟺ FV(e) = ∅

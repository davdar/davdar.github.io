[13 - First Class Functions II](#title)

# First Class Functions

Let's dig into more of the details around first class functions. The language
we are currently working with has integers, plus, times, booleans, if,
variables, let, function creation and function application.

    i ∈ ℤ
    v ∈ var
    e ∈ expr ⩴ i | e + e | e * e
             | b | if e then e else e
             | x | let x = e in e
             | fun x ⇒ e | e e

*Aside: Recall that `e₁ e₂` is the syntax for function application where `e₁`
is the function being applied, and `e₁` is the argument being supplied to the
function. Haskell uses the same syntax for function application, and it differs
from syntax for function application in non-functional languages `e₁(e₂)`. In
those languages, multiple arguments are supplied using the syntax `e₁(e₂,…,eₙ)`
whereas in our core language (and in Haskell) the syntax is just `e₁ e₂ … eₙ`.
Technically, this multiple-argument function application is a chain of single
argument applications `( (((e₁ e₂) e₃) e₄) … ) eₙ`.*

The language we studied just before this had functions, with function
application as an expression, but function definitions had to be top-level:

    x ∈ var
    f ∈ fvar
    e ∈ expr ⩴ … | f(e,…,e)
    c ∈ command ⩴ def f(x,…,x) = e
    p ∈ program ⩴ c … c do e

This design introduced new syntactic categories for (top-level) commands, and
(whole) programs.

In the old language, programs looked like this:


    def f(x) = x + 40
    do f(2)

and the above program now looks like this in our new language:

    let f = fun x ⇒ x + 40 in
    f 2

Basically, (1) we are allowing function definitions *inside* subexpressions,
(2) function definitions (as subexpressions) now evaluate to a value, which is
stored in the normal value environment (not a top-level function environment),
and (3).

This raises a few questions in terms of our language semantics:

- What is the *scope structure*, for our language with first-class functions?
  For example, it's possible to have a function inside of a let-binding, or a
  let-binding inside of a function; how do the scopes interact?

- What is the *substitution-based semantics* for our language with first-class
  functions? Note that the substitution operation `[v/x]e` replaces all *free*
  occurrences of `x` in `e` with the value `v`, so the answer to the previous
  point about scoping semantics will determine how substitution behaves.

- What is the *environment-based semantics* for our language with first-class
  functions? This semantics will be more efficient than the substitution
  semantics, but should agree with the substitution semantics on the meaning of
  any given program.

# Scope Structure for First Class Functions

There are two new syntactic forms in our language: function creation `fun x ⇒
e` and function application `e e`. What is the scoping structure for each one?
For function creation, let's look at some examples:
 
            variable
            references
            ↓   ↓
    fun x ⇒ x + x
        ↑   ↑↑↑↑↑↑
        |   scope of x
        |
        variable
        binder

This is the doubling function, and should make good sense as a program (it
shouldn't crash). Here, the `x` in the body is bound to the `x` that appears
after the keyword `fun`. The body of the function, `x + x`, has the same
scoping structures as the body of the let, as in `let x = … in x + x`.

    (fun x ⇒ 1) + x

Here the `x` variable reference (outside the parens) is out of scope, because
it is not in the body of the function. This program will crash.

    fun 1 ⇒ 2

This is a syntactically ill-formed program: the symbol after the `fun` keyword
must always be a single variable binder.

For function application `e₁ e₂`, there are no binders in the syntax, and no
scope for any binders, so it behaves just like any other binary operation (like
`e₁ + e₂`) w.r.t. scope structure.

Scoping for our new language is defined as follows:

    FV ∈ expr → ℘(var)
    FV(i) ≜ ∅
    FV(e₁ + e₂) ≜ FV(e₁) ∪ FV(e₂)
    FV(e₁ * e₂) ≜ FV(e₁) ∪ FV(e₂)
    FV(b) ≜ ∅
    FV(if e₁ then e₂ else e₃) ≜ FV(e₁) ∪ FV(e₂) ∪ FV(e₃)
    FV(x) ≜ {x}
    FV(let x = e₁ in e₂) ≜ FV(e₁) ∪ (FV(e₂) ∖ {x})
    FV(fun x ⇒ e) ≜ FV(e) ∖  {x}
    FV(e₁ e₂) ≜ FV(e₁) ∪ FV(e₂)

(See the Haskell code for this definition as example X2 in HW06.)

# Substitution-based Semantics for First Class Functions

The usual structure we have had for values, answers and interpreters looks like
this:

    v ∈ value ⩴ i | b
    a ∈ answer ⩴ v | bad

    ⟦_⟧ ∈ expr → answer

This structure stayed the same when we studied substitution-based interpreters
for the language with variables and let.

For environment-based semantics of variables and let, the environment and
interpreter looked like this:

    γ ∈ env ≜ var ⇀ value

    ⟦_⟧ ∈ expr → env → answer

(Things got more complicated with top-level functions, but we won't revisit
that now.)

We are starting with a substitution-based semantics, so we will ignore the
environment-based design for now.

To design a substitution-based semantics for higher-order functions, we need to
decide a few things:

- What is the value that a function creation expression evaluates to?
- What is the meaning of function application?

Function creation is often called an “introduction form” because it introduces
a value, and function application is often called an “elimination form” because
it “eliminates” the function value that was created to perform some
computation. Function application is going to be defined using substitution,
and substitution must agree with the scoping structure we just explored above.

## Substitution

So let's define substitution for our language:

    [_/_]_ ∈ value × var × expr → expr
    [v/x]i ≜ i
    [v/x](e₁ + e₂) ≜ [v/x]e₁ + [v/x]e₂
    [v/x](e₁ * e₂) ≜ [v/x]e₁ * [v/x]e₂
    [v/x]b ≜ b
    [v/x](if e₁ then e₂ else e₃) ≜ if [v/x]e₁ then [v/x]e₂ else [v/x]e₃
    [v/x]y ≜ v    when x = y
    [v/x]y ≜ y    when x ≠ y
    [v/x](let y = e₁ in e₂) ≜ let y = [v/x]e₁ in e₂         when x = y
    [v/x](let y = e₁ in e₂) ≜ let y = [v/x]e₁ in [v/x]e₂    when x ≠ y
    [v/x](fun y ⇒ e) ≜ fun y ⇒ e         when x = y
    [v/x](fun y ⇒ e) ≜ fun y ⇒ [v/x]e    when x ≠ y
    [v/x](e₁ e₂) ≜ [v/x]e₁ [v/x]e₂

(You will implement this in Haskell as E1 in HW06.)

The definitions for language constructs other than function creation and
application are the exact same as we've seen before. To substitute inside a
function creation expression, we have two cases in case the variable we are
looking for is equal to the function binder (`x` and `y` respectively in the
above definition). If the variables are the same `x = y` then any free
occurence of `x` in `e` is actually *not* free outside of `fun y ⇒ e`, because
the `y` binder binds it. So in this case we do not recurse into the body of the
function looking for occurrences of `x`, so the resulting function body is just
`e`. If the variables are different, then free occurrences of `x` in the body
of the function `e` will be free outside of `fun y ⇒ e`, and we should
recursively substitute, resulting in a function body `[v/x]e`.

For function application, we just substitute into the left and the right, and
re-connect as a function application. Note the definition body for this case is
written `[v/x]e₁ [v/x]e₂`, and the space in the middle is the space used to
notate a function application in our programming language syntax.

## Substitution-based Function Values

Remember when we defined top-level functions, a top-level function definition
just recorded the binders and body of the function in a top-level environment,
and only when the function was called later was the body of the function
evaluated. We will follow this intuition and define function values to be `fun
x ⇒ e`, that is, a copy of the function creation syntax.

    v ∈ value ⩴ i | b | fun x ⇒ e
                        ↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑
                        new

Answers stay the same, as do environments.

## Substitution-based Semantics

In the substitution-based semantics, function creation expressions evaluate
immediately to identical function values, and function application is
interpreted as a simple substitution. The full interpreter is as follows:

    ⟦_⟧ ∈ expr → answer
    ⟦i⟧ ≜ i
    ⟦e₁ + e₂⟧ ≜ i₁ + i₂
      where i₁ = ⟦e₁⟧
            i₂ = ⟦e₂⟧
    ⟦e₁ * e₂⟧ ≜ i₁ * i₂
      where i₁ = ⟦e₁⟧
            i₂ = ⟦e₂⟧
    ⟦b⟧ ≜ b
    ⟦if e₁ then e₂ else e₃⟧ ≜ ⟦e₂⟧    if ⟦e₁⟧ = true
    ⟦if e₁ then e₂ else e₃⟧ ≜ ⟦e₃⟧    if ⟦e₁⟧ = false
    ⟦let x = e₁ in e₂⟧ ≜ ⟦[v/x]e₂⟧
      where v = ⟦e₁⟧
    ⟦fun x ⇒ e⟧ ≜ fun x ⇒ e    if FV(e) ⊆ {x}
    ⟦e₁ e₂⟧ ≜ ⟦[v/x]e′⟧
      where fun x ⇒ e′ = ⟦e₁⟧
            v          = ⟦e₂⟧

(You will implement this in Haskell as E2 in HW06.)

Let's start with the last case: function application. The first expression `e₁`
is evaluated and must return a function value. The binder for the function
value is `x` and the body of the function value is `e′`. The second expression
`e₂` is evaluated and should return a value (it shouldn't fail and return
`bad`). Then, the interpretation of the application is to substituted into the
body of the function replacing references to its parameters `x` with the value
`v` returned by evaluating `e₂`: this is written `⟦[v/x]e′⟧` in the definition.

Finally, the function creation case interprets a function creation expression
`⟦fun x ⇒ e⟧` to be just the function definition as a value: `fun x ⇒ e`.
However, there is a strange side-condition: `FV(e) ⊆ {x}`. This side condition
is the same as requiring `fun x ⇒ e` to be a closed expression. (It is closed
if the free variables of `e` are either empty, or exactly `x`, which is the
same as `FV(e) ⊆ {x}`.) This side-condition is necessary to rule out the
following program:

    let f = fun x ⇒ x + y in
    let y = 1 in
    f 2

Without this side-condition, this would evaluate via substitution as:

    let f = fun x ⇒ x + y in
    let y = 1 in
    f 2
    ==
    let y = 1 in
    (fun x ⇒ x + y) 1
    ==
    (fun x ⇒ x + 1) 2
    ==
    2 + 1
    ==
    3

We want this program to instead evaluate to `bad` because `y` is actually not
in scope in the initial definition of `f` and function creation `fun x ⇒ x +
y`, and badly scoped programs should always fail.

This is an instance of *variable capture*, and the offending definition is
actually *substitution*, not necessarily the substitution-based interpreter.
The definition we have of substitution is only correct if we assume the value
`v` has no free variables in it—a new notion now that values can contain
expressions, and expressions can contain variables—and we need to avoid calling
substitution with any such offending values. We maintain this invariant by
making sure we only return values in our interpreter that are closed, hence the
check for `FV(e) ⊆ {x}` in our definition of interpretation for function
creation.

## Environment-based Semantics

In the environment-based semantics we need to change the representation for
function values. This is because in the substitution semantics, a substitution
may change a function before it becomes a value, like so:

    let x = 1 in
    let f = fun y ⇒ x + y in
    f 1
    ==
    let f = fun y ⇒ 1 + y in
    f 1

In this example, when the function becomes a value, it looks like `fun y ⇒ 1 +
y` and not `fun y ⇒ x + y`.

However, in the environment-based semantics, let-bindings are interpreted as an
update to the environment. If we just capture the function creation expression
as-is in an environment semantics, it will look like `fun y ⇒ x + y`, and
either `x` will be free, or `x` might reference value defined after the
creation of the function, which would not agree with the substitution
semantics.

The solution is to *capture* the environment in which the function was created,
along with the function binder and body as the function value:

    v ∈ value ⩴ i | b | ⟨fun x ⇒ e, γ⟩
                        ↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑
                        new

These function values are now called *closures* because they *close* over the
environment when they are created. Then, when a function is called, its
*closure environment* is reinstated, along with a new addition for the function
parameter. The full substitution semantics is as follows:

    ⟦_⟧ ∈ expr → env → answer
    ⟦i⟧(γ) ≜ i
    ⟦e₁ + e₂⟧(γ) ≜ i₁ + i₂
      where i₁ = ⟦e₁⟧(γ)
            i₂ = ⟦e₂⟧(γ)
    ⟦e₁ * e₂⟧(γ) ≜ i₁ * i₂
      where i₁ = ⟦e₁⟧(γ)
            i₂ = ⟦e₂⟧(γ)
    ⟦b⟧(γ) ≜ b
    ⟦if e₁ then e₂ else e₃⟧(γ) ≜ ⟦e₂⟧(γ)    if ⟦e₁⟧(γ) = true
    ⟦if e₁ then e₂ else e₃⟧(γ) ≜ ⟦e₃⟧(γ)    if ⟦e₁⟧(γ) = false
    ⟦let x = e₁ in e₂⟧(γ) ≜ ⟦e₂⟧(γ[x↦v])
      where v = ⟦e₁⟧(γ)
    ⟦fun y ⇒ e⟧(γ) ≜ ⟨fun y ⇒ e, γ⟩
    ⟦e₁ e₂⟧(γ) ≜ ⟦e′⟧(γ′[x↦v])
      where ⟨fun x ⇒ e′, γ′⟩ = ⟦e₁⟧(γ)
            v                = ⟦e₂⟧(γ)

(You will implement this in Haskell as E3 in HW06.)

Notice the interpretation of the function creation expression which captures
the current environment and pairs it with the function in the closure value. In
function application, the first expression `e₁` is evaluated to a closure value
(the value representation for functions), and this closure value `⟨fun x ⇒ e′,
γ′⟩` includes the environment `γ′` which is the environment that was around
*when the closure was created*. The function argument `e₂` is evaluated to a
value `v`, and the body of the function is interpreted *using its closure
environment `γ′`*, and extending it with a mapping from the function's formal
parameter `x` to the argument value `v`.

[21 - Type Systems](#title)

# Type Systems

Type systems are common to many, but not all programming languages. C, C++,
Java and Haskell are examples of languages with type systems, and Python and
Javascript are examples of languages without type systems.

Type systems can serve a number of purposes:

- Necessary information for the compiler
- Checking for programming errors

Type systems are often *overly restrictive*, meaning there are programs which
don't have errors that will not pass the type checker. Type systems are also
*fully automated bug finders*, so they can be immensely valuable as well. You
have spent nearly a whole semester now arguing with Haskell's type checker, so
you are at least familiar with the user-interaction component of type systems
and type checkers.

# Technical Concepts

We are going to focus on:

- type systems (specifications)
- type checkers (algorithms)

First we need to cover some preliminary material on:

- inductively defined sets
- inductively defined properties

# Inductively Defined Sets

In this class you've seen the natural numbers defined like so:

    ℕ ≜ {0,1,…}

This definition of the natural numbers is “informal”. How do we know what
really comes after the `…`? A more pedantic definition of the natural numbers
would be as an inductively constructed set, using the same notation we have
already used to construct syntax. Just like we have already seen:

    e ∈ expr ⩴ i | e + e

we could define the natural numbers as:

    n ∈ ℕ ⩴ 0 | succ 0

Here `succ` isn't an operation, it's a piece of uninterpreted syntax. The
number three is then a linked list:

    three ∈ ℕ ≜ succ (succ (succ 0))

Let's write the natural numbers one last time using a new type of funny
notation:

    ┌─────┐
    │n ∈ ℕ│
    └─────┘

    ───── (1)
    0 ∈ ℕ

    n ∈ ℕ
    ────────── (2)
    succ n ∈ ℕ

The first rules reads: “zero is a natural number.” The second rule reads “*if*
`n` is a natural number, *then* `succ n` is a natural number”. These are called
inference rules, and the general idea for reading them is “if all of the stuff
above the line is true, then the thing below the line is true”. Together these
two rules (1–2) are equivalent to the writing:

    n ∈ ℕ ⩴ 0 | succ n

So why would we use “inference rules”? They appear for now just a more verbose
way of defining tree-like sets. Let's do a quick case study on trees.

## Well-balanced Trees

Let's define (inductively) the set of trees:

    t ∈ tree ⩴ L | ⟨t,t⟩

we are interested in *well-balanced* trees; for example this tree is
well-balanced:

    ⟨⟨L,L⟩,⟨L,L⟩⟩

and these trees are not:

    ⟨⟨L,L⟩,L⟩

    ⟨L,⟨L,L⟩⟩

next we create an *inductively defined relation* using the inference rules
described above, written `t △ n` which is read “tree `t` is well balanced at
height `n`”:

    ┌─────┐
    │t △ n│
    └─────┘
   
    ───── (leaf)
    L △ 1

    t₁ △ n    t₂ △ n
    ───────────────── (node)
    ⟨t₁,t₂⟩ △ (n + 1)


it is the case that if `t △ n` then `t` is well-balanced. We can write a
*proof* of this fact directly using inference rules. E.g., to prove that this
tree is well-balanced:

    ⟨⟨L,L⟩,⟨L,L⟩⟩

we can write this proof that it well-balanced at height 3:

    ─────    ─────    ─────    ─────  (leaf × 4)
    L △ 1    L △ 1    L △ 1    L △ 1
    ──────────────    ──────────────  (node × 2)
      ⟨L,L⟩ △ 2         ⟨L,L⟩ △ 2
    ──────────────────────────────── (node)
          ⟨⟨L,L⟩,⟨L,L⟩⟩ △ 3

this is the primary reason why inference rules are written in this funny way–so
we can stack them together to create a *proof tree* of some inductively defined
property.

# Scoping

Let's define an inductive relation for well-scoping for a tiny programming
language. The relation is `S ⊢ e` and is pronounced “in a scope with `S` bound
variable, program fragment `e` is well-scoped”:

    x ∈ var ≈ symbol
    e ∈ expr ⩴ i | e + e
             | x | let x = e in e

    S ∈ scope ≜ ℘(var)

    ┌─────┐
    │S ⊢ e│
    └─────┘
    
    ───── (int)
    S ⊢ i

    S ⊢ e₁
    S ⊢ e₂
    ─────────── (plus)
    S ⊢ e₁ + e₂

    x ∈ S
    ───── (var)
    S ⊢ x

    S ⊢ e₁
    {x}∪S ⊢ e₂
    ──────────────────── (let)
    S ⊢ let x = e₁ in e₂

And we have a pair of theorems:

- If `S ⊢ e` then `FV(e) ⊆ S`
- If `FV(e) ⊆ S` then `S ⊢ e`

and a pair of corollaries:

- If `∅ ⊢ e` then `e` is closed.
- If `e` is closed then `∅ ⊢ e`.

(The proofs are by structural induction on the term `e`—we won't get into the
proof details in this class.)

# Simple Types (no variables)

Let's start with a simple type system for a programming language with just
integers, plus, booleans, and if:

    e ∈ expr ⩴ i | e + e
             | b | if e then e else e

    τ ∈ type ⩴ int | bool

a *simple type system* for this language relates a term to a type, written `e :
τ` and pronounced “program fragment `e` has type `τ`”. The type system is
defined inductively (using inference rules) and is designed such that if `e :
τ`, then `e` is guaranteed to (1) not crash the interpreter due to a scope or
runtime type error, and (2) return a value of type `τ` as the final result.

    ┌─────┐
    │e : τ│
    └─────┘
    
    ─────── (int)
    i : int

    e₁ : int
    e₂ : int
    ───────────── (plus)
    e₁ + e₂ : int

    ──────── (bool)
    b : bool

    e₁ : bool
    e₂ : τ
    e₃ : τ
    ───────────────────────── (if)
    if e₁ then e₂ else e₃ : τ

The (if) rule is worth discussing. First, the use of the same `τ` above the
line can be read to say “when `e₂` and `e₃` have the same type, and that type
is `τ`, then the resulting type of the `if` expression is that same `τ`”. That
is, it doesn't matter what type the result of the `if` expression has, so long
as it is the same as the sub-terms `e₂` and `e₃`.

## Simple Types (variables)

Let's add variables and let to our language:

    e ∈ expr ⩴ i | e + e
             | b | if e then e else e
             | x | let x = e in e

    τ ∈ type ⩴ int | bool
    
    Γ ∈ tenv ≜ var ⇀ type

    ┌─────────┐
    │Γ ⊢ e : τ│
    └─────────┘
    
    ─────────── (int)
    Γ ⊢ i : int

    Γ ⊢ e₁ : int
    Γ ⊢ e₂ : int
    ───────────────── (plus)
    Γ ⊢ e₁ + e₂ : int

    ──────────── (bool)
    Γ ⊢ b : bool

    Γ ⊢ e₁ : bool
    Γ ⊢ e₂ : τ
    Γ ⊢ e₃ : τ
    ───────────────────────────── (if)
    Γ ⊢ if e₁ then e₂ else e₃ : τ

    ──────────── (var)
    Γ ⊢ x : Γ(x)

    Γ ⊢ e₁ : τ₁
    Γ[x↦τ₁] ⊢ e₂ : τ₂ 
    ───────────────────────── (let)
    Γ ⊢ let x = e₁ in e₂ : τ₂

Notice the new structure `Γ`, which acts like the scope environment `S` from
before, and is a static approximation of the interpreter environment `γ`:
whereas `γ` maps variables to values, `Γ` maps variables to their types.

The type environment `Γ` serves to place *assumptions* on the types of free
variables in the term `e`. A top-level program will have no free variables, and
a typing judgment for a top-level term `e` will look like `∅ ⊢ e : τ`. Because
this is so common—notating a type judgment with an empty type environment, we
just write `⊢ e : τ` when the type environment is empty.

## Specification vs Algorithm

The relation `Γ ⊢ e : τ` defined above is an *inductively defined relation*
which tells you that a good thing is true about `e` when `Γ ⊢ e : τ`. However,
we are interested in an *algorithm* that *checks* whether or not `Γ ⊢ e : τ`
for some `Γ` and `τ`. This algorithm is called a *type checker*, whereas the
inductively defined relation is called a *type system*. The type checker is (1)
algorithmic, and (2) should return results consistent with the definition of
the type system (the specification).

Here is the type checker written in algorithm form, as in interpreter:

    ⦇_⦈ ∈ expr → tenv → maybe(type)
    ⦇i⦈(Γ) ≜ int
    ⦇e₁ + e₂⦈(Γ) ≜ int
      where int = ⦇e₁⦈(Γ)
            int = ⦇e₂⦈(Γ)
    ⦇b⦈(Γ) ≜ bool
    ⦇if e₁ then e₂ else e₃⦈(Γ) ≜ τ
      where bool = ⦇e₁⦈(Γ)
            τ    = ⦇e₂⦈(Γ)
            τ    = ⦇e₃⦈(Γ)
    ⦇x⦈(Γ) ≜ τ
      where τ = Γ(x)
    ⦇let x = e₁ in e₂⦈(Γ) ≜ τ₂
      where τ₁ = ⦇e₁⦈(Γ)
            τ₂ = ⦇e₂⦈(Γ[x↦τ₁])

Notice the following:

- The type checker `⦇_⦈` has very similar structure as the normal interpreter
  `⟦_⟧`.
- In the `if` case, there are two clauses for `τ = …`. This means that *both*
  of those `τ` have to be the same, so in the full implementation of the type
  checker, there will be an equality check that the type result from `⦇e₂⦈` and
  `⦇e₃⦈` are equal.
- The let rule for `⦇_⦈` looks just like the one for `⟦_⟧`, but with types
  instead of values.

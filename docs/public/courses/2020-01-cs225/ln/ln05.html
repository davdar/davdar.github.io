[05 - Trees 3 Ways](#title)

# Trees

Trees typically look like this:

        •          2
       / \        / \ 
      •   3      1   3
     / \        / \ / \
    1   2       • • • •

The first I would call a “values in the leaves” binary tree, and the second a
“value in the branches” binary tree. Let's just use the second type for now.

Later on we will look at syntax trees. These trees have information at both
values and branches, like this syntax tree for the expression 1 + 2.

      +
     / \
    1   2

Trees have recursive structure: a tree is either a leaf or a branch, and
branches have an integer value at the branch, a left sub-tree and a right
sub-tree.

# Trees in C++

The trees you have seen so far are binary search trees from CS 124, implemented
in C++. Let's take a look at that implementation:

    // This code is borrowed from Lisa Dion. I will return it to her after this
    // class so she can use it later this semester in UVM CS 124.
    class BinarySearchTree {
    private:
        struct BinaryNode {
            Comparable value;
            BinaryNode* leftChild;
            BinaryNode* rightChild;
    
            // Constructors
            // ...
        };
    
        void destroy(BinaryNode* &n) { ... }
        BinaryNode* copyNode(BinaryNode* n) { ... }
        bool find(const Comparable &c, BinaryNode* n) const { 
          if (n == nullptr) { return false; }
          if (c < n->value) { return find(c, n->leftChild); }
          if (n->value < c) { return find(c, n->rightChild); } return true; 
        }
    }

A few things to notice that are different between C++ and Haskell.

1. In C++, you must be explicit about which values are behind pointers (`*`) or
   not; in Haskell there are pointers in the implementation, but we never need
   to talk about them in the code (just like in Python and Java).
2. In C++, `nullptr` is a value of any pointer type you can use to encode
   information (like if a tree is a leaf or not); in Haskell there is no
   `nullptr` value that is a value of any pointer type.
3. In C++, memory management is explicit (e.g., `destroy`) through `new` and
   `delete` syntax; in Haskell memory management is implicit (just like in
   Python and Java)
4. In C++, if you want to change a tree and don't want other pieces of your
   program to be affected by the changes, you first need to copy the tree and
   then make the changes. (Java and Python are similar.) In Haskell (and math),
   it is not possible to “change” values in a tree, you can only take them
   apart and put them back together. The term for this is that values in
   Haskell are “immutable”.
5. In C++, there are two nested case analyses going on in `find`. The first
   case analysis is whether or note the node is a leaf or a branch. If it's a
   leaf, we return and do not run the rest of the code. If it's a branch, there
   are three remaining cases: the branch value is strictly less than, strictly
   greater than, or equal to the thing we are looking for (`c`). These nested
   cases are made linear in C++ because of the short-circuiting control flow of
   C++. In particular, notice that once we test for `n == nullptr` and the test
   fails, we know that the node object must be a branch, and therefore it is ok
   to access the `value`, `leftChild` and `rightChild` fields.

# Trees in Math

Before we translate this C++ to Haskell, let's first write down a formal
definition of trees in pure math.

    when we
    write ‘t’
    we always
    mean an
    element of
    a tree
    |  
    |   a set       a tree is a branch
    |   called      with an integer and
    |   a tree  or  two subtrees inside
    ↓   ↓↓↓↓     ↓ ↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓
    t ∈ tree ⩴ • | ⟨ i : t , t ⟩
      ↑        ↑
    we are     a tree is either
    defining   a leaf
    a set

This is very compact mathematical notation for describing a set of elements.
Each variant `L` and `<i:t,t>` describe patterns for elements in the set, or
ways of creating elements in the set. To create new trees, we can use either of
these patterns. To pull information out of a tree, we must first consider that
any tree could be either of these two patterns, and handle each case
accordingly.

For example, this tree we had before:

       2
      / \ 
     1   3
    / \ / \
    • • • •

is written as:
    
    ⟨ 2 : ⟨ 1 : • , • ⟩ , ⟨ 3 : • , • ⟩ ⟩ 

Let's define `find` over math trees; note the absence of anything that (1)
talks about memory, (2) has short-circuiting control flow, or (3) “changes”
anything.

    find ∈ ℤ × tree → 𝔹
    find(i, t) ≜
      false    if t = •
      …        if t = ⟨ i : t₁ , t₂ ⟩

this notation isn't scaling very well for a nested pattern match; let's change
to Haskell notation:

    find ∈ ℤ × tree → 𝔹
    find(i, t) ≜ cases
      t = • → false
      t = ⟨ i′ : t₁ , t₂ ⟩ → cases
        i < i′ → find(i, t₁)
        i > i′ → find(i, t₂)
        i = i′ → true

# Trees in Haskell

Now let's translate this math into Haskell. 

Step 1: translate the definition of the set `tree` into the Haskell datatype
`Tree`:

    data Tree = Leaf
              | Node Int Tree Tree

Note the similarity to the definition in math, and the relationship to the
struct definition in C++, as well as the relationship between `Leaf` in Haskell
with `nullptr` in C++.

Step 2: translate the definition of `find` to a Haskell function:

    find :: Int -> Tree -> Bool
    ...

First notice that the type for find in Haskell is a little different from the
set that find lives in in math.

    ℤ × tree → 𝔹
    vs
    ℤ → tree → 𝔹

The parentheses in the second type are right-associative, so it's really:

    ℤ × tree → 𝔹
    vs
    ℤ → (tree → 𝔹)

The first type is a function which takes a single argument which is a pair, and
returns a single value. The second type is a function which takes a single
argument which is an integer, and returns a function which takes a single
argument as a tree, and returns a boolean. That is, all functions of multiple
arguments can also be written as functions of single arguments, where when we
need more arguments, we just return a function which takes one more arguments.
This is called currying, and the ability to define functions which return
functions is a unique feature of functional programming languages which we will
discuss more later.

    find :: Int -> Tree -> Bool
    find i t = case t of
      Leaf -> False
      Node i' t1 t2 ->
        if i < i' 
          then find i t1
          else if i > i'
            then find i t2
            else True

Things to note:
- Haskell is whitespace sensitive: pattern match cases need to be indented and
  aligned.
- Haskell syntax for function application is `f x y` and not `f(x, y)`
- Haskell datatypes are defined with different cases. In each case, the first
  name is the name of the “constructor”; these are used to construct values, as
  well as to indicate pattern match cases. The types that are listed after a
  constructor name are the types of values contained in a value created with
  that pattern, so in the case of `| Node Int Tree Tree`, “Node” is the
  name of the constructor (and we could have picked a different name), whereas
  `Int Tree Tree` indicates that a Node carries with it three values, each of
  type `Int`, `Tree` and `Tree` respectively.

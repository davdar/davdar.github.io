[07 - Partiality ⅋ Sets](#title)

# Review: A Core Language and Interpreter

Remember the core language we discussed last time:

    i ∈ ℤ
    e ∈ expr ⩴ i
             | e + e
             | e * e
    v ∈ value ≜ ℤ
    a ∈ answer ≜ value

    interp ∈ expr → answer
    interp(i) ≜ i
    interp(e₁ + e₂) ≜ interp(e₁) + interp(e₂)
    interp(e₁ * e₂) ≜ interp(e₁) * interp(e₂)

# Partiality in Interpretation

Let's consider another extension which can't be desugared—division:

    e ∈ expr ⩴ i
             | e + e
             | e * e
             -- NEW
             | e / e

Our interpreter is changed in two ways:

1. The set `value` now contains rational numbers `ℚ`, not just integers `ℤ`
2. The interpreter is undefined in some cases (a.k.a, is partial), e.g., `5 /
   0` has no meaning

To handle (1) we redefine values to be rational numbers `q ∈ ℚ`:

    v ∈ value ≜ ℚ

There are two ways to communicate the meaning of expressions. One is to defer
to what is defined or not in math:

    interp ∈ expr ⇀ value
      ⋮
    interp(e₁ / e₂) ≜ interp(e₁) / interp(e₂)

This is “not wrong”, but we can do better by making the “partiality” explicit.
To do this, we define a new set `answer` as follows:

    a ∈ answer ⩴ v
               -- NEW
               | BAD

The answer `BAD` is an explicit result value that means “something bad
happened”. For this language, we will signal `BAD` when division by zero
happens.

    interp ∈ expr → answer
      ⋮
    interp(e₁ / e₂) ≜ q₁ / q₂
      when interp(e₁) = q₁
      and  interp(e₂) = q₂
      and  q₂ ≠ 0
    interp(e₁ / e₂) ≜ BAD
      when interp(e₁) = BAD
      or   interp(e₂) = BAD
      or   interp(e₂) = 0

In Haskell, this will look something closer to:

    interp ∈ expr → answer
     ⋮
    interp(e₁ / e₂) ≜
      case interp(e₁), interp(e₂):
        q₁,  q₂ | q₂ ≠ 0 → q₁ / q₂
        q₁,  q₂ | q₂ = 0 → BAD
        BAD, q₂          → BAD
        q₁,  BAD         → BAD
        BAD, BAD         → BAD

or:

    interp ∈ expr → answer
     ⋮
    interp(e₁ / e₂) ≜
      case interp(e₁), interp(e₂):
        q₁, q₂ | q₂ ≠ 0 → q₁ / q₂
        otherwise       → BAD

# Sets and Maps

Moving forward we will be using finite sets and maps in our descriptions of
programming languages, and it's important that we are comfortable manipulating
them in Haskell.

## Sets

In math we write `A ∈ set` for "A is a set", and `x ∈ A` for "x is an element
of the set A". Sets can be infinite in size and conceptual, e.g., “set of all
points on a circle”. Often we want to manipulate finite sets of things in an
algorithm, and most programming languages offer a datatype for sets to support
this. The main idea behind a set is that it's like a list where the order
doesn't matter, and repeated elements don't matter. A finite set is written in
math as e.g., `{1, 2, 3}`, and this is the same set as `{3, 2, 2, 1}`.

In Haskell, the set datatype is called `Set`, and it is written with another
type next to it as the type of values in the set. E.g., `Set Int` is a set of
integers, and `Set String` is a set of strings.

See the [online documentation for
Sets](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/containers-0.6.2.1/docs/Data-Set.html)
in Haskell for more information.

Each operation over sets in Haskell will be written with `Set.` as a prefix, so
`Set.union` for the union operation on sets.

Key operations on sets in Haskell are:

-   Set membership:

        Set.member :: Ord a => a -> Set a -> Bool

    The `a` in the type is a *type variable*, and when you use the type, you can
    pick any type for `a` that you like. So if you pick `a = Int`, you will have
    a function type `Int -> Set Int -> Bool`. Remember that although there are
    two function arrows in the type, this is really just a two-argument function
    that takes an integer (like `2`) as its first argument, a set of integers
    (like `{2, 3}`) as its second argument, and returns `True` or `False` (in
    this case, `True`).

    The `Ord a =>` part of the type is called a *constraint*, because it
    constrains the polymorphic type `a` so that it must support comparison
    operations. You can pick the type of `Set.member` to be `Int -> Set Int ->
    Bool` because `Int` is a type that satisfies the `Ord` constraint. If a type
    does not satisfy `Ord`, then you can't create sets of that type.

-   The empty set:

        Set.empty :: Set a

-   The singleton set:

        Set.singleton :: a -> Set a

-   Set union:

        Set.union :: Ord a => Set a -> Set a -> Set a

-   Set intersection:

        Set.intersection :: Ord a => Set a -> Set a -> Set a

-   Set difference:

        Set.difference :: Ord a => Set a -> Set a -> Set a

-   Set size:

        Set.size :: Set a -> Int

-   Inserting an element into a set:

        Set.insert :: Ord a => a -> Set a -> Set a

-   Deleting an element from a set:

        Set.delete :: Ord a => a -> Set a -> Set a

-   Conversion to and from lists:

        Set.fromList :: Ord a => [a] -> Set a
        Set.toList :: Set a -> [a]

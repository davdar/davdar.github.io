[15 - Mutation II](#title)

# The new interpreter for mutation

We have two problems to solve in defining an interpreter for this new language:

1. how to interpret new language features (box, dereference, assign)
2. how to interpret existing language features in the presence of the new ones

What does this program mean?

    let x = box 1 in
    (x ← 2) + (x ← 3) + !x

Here there are some updates to boxes. What order are they evaluated in? What is
the resulting value of an assignment `x ← 2`?

We are going to:

1. fix a *left-to-right* evaluation order, and
2. decide (somewhat arbitrarily) that the result of an assignment is the value
   that was produce by the right-hand-side.

Just as we notated the environment `γ`, we notate the store `σ`. Remember, the
environment `γ` maps variables to values, and locations/boxes can be values,
and the store `σ` maps locations/boxes to values.

The above program then evaluates in an environment-store-based semantics:

    γ = ∅
    σ = ∅
    e = let x = box 1 in
        (x ← 2) + (x ← 3) + !x
    ==
    γ = {x     ↦ loc 0}
    σ = {loc 0 ↦ 1}
    (x ← 2) + (x ← 3) + !x
    ==
    γ = {x     ↦ loc 0}
    σ = {loc 0 ↦ 2}
    2 + (x ← 3) + !x
    ==
    γ = {x     ↦ loc 0}
    σ = {loc 0 ↦ 3}
    2 + 3 + !x
    ==
    γ = {x     ↦ loc 0}
    σ = {loc 0 ↦ 3}
    2 + 3 + 3
    ==
    8

The consequence of this is that interpretation of `+` must (1) *propagate* the
side-effects that occur in sub-expressions, and (2) do so in left-to-right
order.

The interpretation of plus looks like so:

    ⟦e₁ + e₂⟧(γ, σ) ≜ (i₁+i₂,σ″)
      where (i₁,σ′) = ⟦e₁⟧(γ,σ)
      and   (i₂,σ″) = ⟦e₂⟧(γ,σ′)

Let's break down everything that is happening here:

- `e₁ + e₂` is the expression being interpreted
- `γ` and `σ` are the initial environment and store respectively
- First, `e₁` is interpreted in the initial environment and store `γ` and `σ`,
  and this returns the resulting integer value `i₁`, and the *new store* `σ′`.
- Next, `e₂` is interpreted. It is also interpreted in the initial environment
  `γ`, just like `e₁`, but it is not interpreted in the initial store `σ`,
  rather, it is interpreted in the *updated* store `σ′`. This returns the
  integer value `i₂` as well as *another* new updated store `σ″`. 
- The final result of interpretation is the sum of the resulting values, `i₁ +
  i₂`, as well as the final resulting store, `σ″`.

Interpretation of new language features looks like so:

    ⟦box e⟧(γ,σ) ≜ (ℓ, σ″)
      where (v,σ′) = ⟦e⟧(γ,σ)
            σ″     = σ′[ℓ↦v]
            ℓ is fresh in σ′
    ⟦!e⟧(γ,σ) ≜ (v,σ′)
      where (ℓ,σ′) = ⟦e⟧(γ,σ)
            v      = σ′(ℓ)
    ⟦e₁ ← e₂⟧(γ,σ) ≜ (v,σ‴)
      where (ℓ,σ′) = ⟦e₁⟧(γ,σ)
            (v,σ″) = ⟦e₂(γ,σ′)
            σ‴     = σ″[ℓ↦v]

## What About Functions?

We now have two “fancy” language features:

- first-class functions (closures)
- first-class references (boxes)

We've seen how each feature behaves in isolation, but how do they interact?
Let's look at a program.

    let y = box 10 in
    let f = fun x ⇒ x + !y in
    y ← 20 ;
    let y = box 30 in
    f 100

Here we have a program that creates a closure, capturing a value which is a
box, and then proceeds by changing the box, as well as introducing a new
binding for the closure variable, and then calls the function.

What should the result be?

1. `110`
2. `120`
3. `130`

The correct answer is `120`. First, the closure `fun x ⇒ x + !y` capture the
current environment, which maps the variable `y` to a freshly created box with
contents `10`. Next, the value of the box is changed to `20`. Next, the
environment maps `y` to a new box which contains 30. However, the closure
environment for the function bound to `f` still maps `y` to the old box. When
`f` is called with argument `100`, we reinstate the environment which maps `y`
to the first/old box, however this box still points to `20`. The closure
capture the environment when it is create, but it does not capture the store—it
uses the most recent store from the calling site of the function. The body of
the function then adds `100` to the contents of the first box created in the
program, `20`, and returns `120`.

In this example, we saw that creating a closure captures the environment, but
not the store, and that the store is “threaded through” the program in a purely
sequential fashion—it is never “captured”, or “restored” to an older state.

The interpretation of function creation and application is then as follows:

    ⟦fun x ⇒ e⟧(γ,σ) ≜ (⟨fun x ⇒ e , γ ⟩, σ)
    ⟦e₁ e₂⟧(γ,σ) ≜ ⟦e⟧(γ″,σ″)
      where (⟨ fun x ⇒ e , γ′ ⟩,σ′) = ⟦e₁⟧(γ,σ)
            (v,σ″)                  = ⟦e₂⟧(γ,σ′)
            γ″                      = γ′[x↦v]

### Intro to Verification

#### Specification
- verification = algorithm + specification + proof
    + algorithm = Java/Python/pseudocode/math
    + specification = annotations/math
    + proof = automatic-tool/math
- in this class (and in Agda) we will unify each of these settings (it's all
  math)
- running theme: definitions matter

#### Algorithm ᴠ Specification
- You are probably used to thinking of these as separate entities. E.g.,
  algorithms are written in a programming language and math is written on
  paper. This is a good starting intuition, but we will start to blur these
  lines.
- Notation for today:
  + `p : A → B` is an algorithm `p` that computes a `B` given input `A`
  + `p ∈ A → B` is a mathematical function `p` that *specifies* a mapping
    from `A` things to `B` things (but not necessarily how to *compute*
    something)
  + we will write `⟦p⟧ ∈ A → B` as the injection of programs `p : A → B` into
    “math world”
  + in addition to sets and functions in math world, we also have
    propositions and logical formulas, like implication `P ⟹ Q` and
    quantification `∀ x∈X. P(x)` (for propositions `P` and `Q` and sets `X`).

E.g., consider the famous halting problem for Turing machines. The theorem
says:

> There does not exist an algorithm which, when given an arbitrary turing
> machine as input, outputs true if and only if the turing machine halts.

In notation we would write this as a theorem `hp`:

    hp ≜ ¬∃p:(𝑇𝑀 → 𝔹) 𝑠𝑡 ∀ m ∈ 𝑇𝑀. ⟦p⟧(m) = true ⟺ halts(m)

This is equivalent to:

    hp ≜ ¬∃p:(𝑇𝑀 → 𝔹) 𝑠𝑡 ∀ m ∈ 𝑇𝑀. ⟦p⟧(m) = true ⟹ halts(m) ∧ ⟦p⟧(m) = false ⟹ ¬halts(m)

The reason for this is due to contraposition:

    (1) (A ⟹ B) ⟺  (2) (¬B ⟹ ¬A)
    (3) (B ⟹ A) ⟺  (4) (¬A ⟹ ¬B)

The first says (1) and (3), while the second says (1) and (4).

However, there *does* exist a (non-algorithmic) function which maps turing
machines to their halting behavior:

    p ∈ 𝑇𝑀 → 𝔹
    p(m) ≜ true  if halts(m)
    p(m) ≜ false if ¬halts(m)

The theorem `hp` says that no *algorithm* `p : 𝑇𝑀 → 𝔹` exists, but the
mapping is perfectly valid as a mathematical function.

#### Specifications for Sorting
Let's try to write a specification for sorting:
-   `fancy-sort : list → list`
-   `fancy-sort : vec → vec`
-   `fancy-sort : list(int) → list(int)`
-   `fancy-sort : ∀ X. ordered(X) ⟹   list(X) → list(X)`
-   `fancy-sort : list(int) → { xs ∈ vec(int) | sorted(xs) }`   
    (is this the full spec? no.)
-   `fancy-sort : { xs ∈ vec(int) } → { ys ∈ list(int) | sorted(xs) ∧ (∀ x. x ∈ xs ⟺ x ∈ ys)}`   
    (is this the full spec? oops wrote xs instead of ys.)
-   `fancy-sort : { xs ∈ vec(int) } → { ys ∈ list(int) | sorted(ys) ∧ (∀ x. x ∈ xs ⟺ x ∈ ys)}`   
    (is this the full spec? no. allowed to drop/add elements.)
-   `fancy-sort : { xs ∈ vec(int) } → { ys ∈ list(int) | sorted(ys) ∧ perm(xs,ys)}`   
-   what's wrong with a spec like this?   
    `fancy-sort : { xs ∈ vec(int) } → { ys ∈ list(int) | ys = sort(xs) }`   
    nothing! In particular:
    +   `sort` here need not be an algorithm
    +   `sort` need not be efficient or clever
    +   E.g., `sort(xs) = selection-sort(xs)` and `fancy-sort(xs) =
        quick-sort(xs)`, i.e., verifying that quick-sort is equal to selection-sort
        is a valid way to verify quick-sort.
-   what else could go wrong? we aren't saying anything about `fancy-sort` not
    being a stupid slow algorithm. E.g.   

        fancy-sort(xs) ≜ 
          let ys = random-list()
          if is-sorted(ys) ∧ is-permutation(xs,ys)
            return ys
          else
            fancy-sort(xs)

    this algorithm terminates with probability one, but is incredibly
    inefficient. How would you specify that it is efficient? (E.g., O(N) running
    time?)

        cost(fancy-sort,xs) = length(xs)
        cost(fancy-sort,xs) ≤ length(xs)
        cost(fancy-sort,xs) ≤ c*length(xs)
        cost(fancy-sort,xs) ≤ c*length(xs) + d
        [✗] ∀ xs. ∃ c,d 𝑠𝑡 cost(fancy-sort,xs) ≤ c*length(xs) + d
        [✓] ∃ c,d 𝑠𝑡 ∀ xs. cost(fancy-sort,xs) ≤ c*length(xs) + d

    notice that we can't use `⟦_⟧`, we need an explicit `cost` function. In Agda
    we will get `⟦_⟧` for free, but not `cost`, which makes the verification of
    running times a lot harder.

How would you define `sorted`?   

    sorted ∈ list → prop
    sorted(xs) ≜ ?

This begs the question… how is `list` defined? I can think of two ways. First,
defined as a function—this is the “extensional” definition, and how a
mathematician might define it:

    e ∈ elem
    xs ∈ list ≜ { f ∈ ℕ ⇀ elem | ∀ i &lt; j. f(j) defined ⟹ f(i) defined 
                               ∧ ∃i. f(i) not defined }

Second, the “intensional” definition, and how a computer scientist might define
it:

    e ∈ elem
    xs ∈ list ⩴ ∅ | e⋅xs

and where the indexing function is defined inductively:

    e[_] ∈ ℕ ⇀ elem
    ∅[n] not defined
    (e⋅xs)[0] ≜ e
    (e⋅xs)[n+1] ≜ (e⋅xs)[n]

Both are equivalent. Some specs are easier to state for one of the other, and
some proofs are easier to write for one or the other.

Back to sorted… I can think of two ways to define sorted. First, using the
extensional definition:

    sorted(xs) ≜ ∀i ≤ j. xs(i) ≤ xs(j)

sorted-ness is the same as the extensional behavior of the indexing function
(`f ∈ ℕ ⇀ elem` above) being monotonic. Cool!

Second, using the intensional definition:

    sorted(∅) ≜ true
    sorted(e⋅xs) ≜ sorted(xs) ∧ e ≤ head(xs)

where
    
    head ∈ list → 𝔹⊎❴∞❵
    head(∅) = ∞
    head(e⋅xs) = e

What about defining permutation? As we saw before, this definition doesn't cut
it:

    perm(xs,ys) ≜ ∀x. x ∈ xs ⟺ x ∈ ys

however a counting function could be used instead of pure membership:

    perm(xs,ys) ≜ ∀ x. count(x,xs) = count(x,ys)

we could also define permutation inductively:

    perm(∅,ys) ≜ ys = ∅
    perm(e⋅xs,ys) ≜ e ∈ ys ∧ perm(xs,remove(e,ys))

or purely extensionally (as a mathematician would) as the existence of a
permutation function:

    perm(xs,ys) ≜ ∃ π ∈ (dom(xs)∩dom(ys)) → (dom(xs)∩dom(ys)) 𝑠𝑡 π is 1-to-1 ∧ ∀ i. xs(i) = ys(π(i))

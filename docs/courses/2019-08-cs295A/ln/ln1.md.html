### Welcome ⅋ Overview

#### Syllabus

- david.darais.com
- Office Hours: 
  + This week: Thursday 11:30--12:30 (Aug 29)
  + Next week: Tuesday 11:30--12:30 (Sep 5) 
  + Subsequent weeks: TBD (will send poll)
- Course Piazza: 
  + *all course announcements posted here*
  + *all homework help questions should go here*
  + *only guaranteed response for questions &gt; 24 hours before deadline*
  + For students to discuss course material with each other
- Textbook:
  + loosely following two book
  + you should only need lecture notes and in class exercises to succeed on homework
  + both books are free if you want to look at them
- Software:
  + We will use Agda, and you will interact through Emacs or Atom
  + First assignment you will get software set up; I will supply a VM
- Grades: 
  + 81% assignments, 19% final project
  + No late work; 10 assignments and I drop lowest
  + Homeworks 6–10 can be done in pairs
  + Group project is groups 1–3. More is expected of those taking for graduate
    credit.
- Collaboration + External Resources:
  + No copying. No sending full solutions to anyone.
  + Yes discussing and helping.
  + Collaboration and using external resources is encouraged. 
  + Document external resources: blog posts, stackoverflow, etc.
  + No posting exact problems online asking for help.
  + If you document collaboration and external resources, you will be 100%
    fine. If I have an issue with your level of collaboration or use of
    external resources I will let you know and as long as you don't do it again
    I will be very happy.
- Course Description
  + How to achieve 0 bugs in software?
  + Not by testing! 
  + In this course you will write programs; you will write 0 tests; when you
    and Agda are done arguing with each other, your code will have exactly 0
    bugs
  + lightweight v middleweight v heavyweight
  + automated v manual
  + expressive v restricted
  + CompCert
  + CSmith
  + Heartbleed
  + Everest
  + DeepSpec

#### Logistics

- We will go slow and may not make it through all topics. My goal is for
  everyone to learn the material at a comfortable pace.
- The overall goal is to set you up to verify a program of your choice as a
  final project.
- All assignments are writing code+proofs in a proof assistant. If your
  assignment typechecks, you are guaranteed 100% on the assignment.
- I plan on doing a few problems in class the day the assignment is released.

#### Proof Assistants ⅋ Agda
Agda is:
- A powerful programming language (similar to Haskell or OCaml)
- You can also write proofs (literally any proof)
- Proofs look just like code
- You can write
    + Just code
    + Just proofs
    + Proof about code
    + Code and proofs intertwined (“correct-by-construction”)

#### Class Outcomes

- Mathematic proof and logical reasoning
    + Small and simple core foundation
    + Proving = programming
    + You will gain a deep understanding of principles like induction and
      logical quantification
- The art of specification
    + Necessary and challenging, even for testing
    + It's an art
- The art of verification
    + The spec matters
    + The spec is trusted
    + Some specs which are equivalent in principle may be very different in
      how easy they are to verify. Some specs are stronger than others. Some
      specs are less complex than others. You want the simplest possible spec
      because the spec is trusted—how do you know you got the spec right?
- A final project you can show off (to friends, parents, future employers,
  etc.) 

#### Last Year's Final Projects

- Cauchy sequences (how to represent `ℝ`?)
- Differential privacy DSL (how to write provably private algorithms?)
- Finger trees (how to best represent persistent sequences?)
- GCD (how to find greatest common divisor?)
- Gradient descent (how to fit data to a linear system?)
- Linear-congruence random numbers (how to not screw up RNG?)
- Minimax AI algorithm (how to win always at tic-tac-toe?)
- Parser combinators (how to parse arbitrary context-free languages?)
- Smith numbers (how to use prime factorization?)
- Tic-tac-toe (how to model game theory?)

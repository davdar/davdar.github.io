# Natural Numbers

What are the natural numbers? Is there a difference between “the” natural
numbers, and a set which is “the same” as them? I don't have an answer for what
the natural numbers “are” so today I will show you a set that is just like
them.

There are two ways to define a set: (1) axiomatically described and (2)
inductively constructed. Today, and in Agda, we will exclusively be doing (2).
For those with a math background this might feel strange; mathematicians are
very accustomed to always doing (1).

In English, we define the natural numbers inductively (via (2)) as follows:

The natural numbers is defined as some set `ℕ` s.t.:

- `Z` is an element of `ℕ` (written `Z ∈ ℕ`)
- If `n` is an element of `ℕ` then `S(n)` is an element of `ℕ` (written `n ∈ ℕ ⟹ S(n) ∈ ℕ`)

An alternative notation for the same definition is via a grammar, which is more
compact:

    n ∈ ℕ ⩴ Z | S(n)

A more verbose version of the above is:

    ────────
    Z ∈ ℕ


    n ∈ ℕ
    ─────────
    S(n) ∈ ℕ

We are defining a set of numbers `ℕ` inductively. `Z ∈ ℕ` says that `zero` is
in the set `ℕ`. `n ∈ ℕ ⫽ S(n) ∈ ℕ` says that `S(n)` is in the set `ℕ` when `n`
is in the set `ℕ`.

Given this definition of natural numbers, how do we define plus?

    _+_ ∈ ℕ × ℕ → ℕ
    Z + n ≜ n
    S(m) + n ≜ S(m+n)

This definition is well-founded because it is defined for all elements in the
domain (all natural numbers). How do we know this? (Agda is checking this for
us.) I.e., what is wrong with these definitions:

    Z + n ≜ n
    m + S(n) ≜ S(m+n)

In Agda:

    ℕ : Set
    Z : ℕ → ℕ
    S : ℕ → ℕ → ℕ
    _+_ : ℕ → ℕ → ℕ

That is, we write binary operations as “a function from the first argument to a
function of the second argument”. The term for this is “currying”.

How would we define multiplication?

    _×_ ∈ ℕ × ℕ → ℕ
    Z × n ≜ Z
    S(m) × n ≜ n + m × n

Subtraction?

    _-_ ∈ ℕ × ℕ ⇀ ℕ
    m - Z ≜ m
    S(m) - S(n) ≜ m - n

Agda will force us to make total functions. It is easy to recover partial
functions as total functions to a set with a distinguished “not defined”
element. To get around that, let's just define a funny minus operation which is
total. We will make the arbitrary choice that `Z - m = Z`.

    _∸_ ∈ ℕ × ℕ → ℕ
    Z ∸ n ≜ Z
    m ∸ Z ≜ m
    S(m) ∸ S(n) ≜ m ∸ n

# Proof by Induction

Natural numbers have some nice properties which are given the following names:

- `+` units: `m + 0 = 0 + m = m`
- `+` associativity: `m + (n + p) = (m + n) + p`
- `+` commutativity: `m + n = n + m`
- `×` zeros: `m × 0 = 0 × m = 0`
- `×` units: `m × 1 = 1 × m = 1`
- `×` associativity: `m × (n × p) = (m × n) × p`
- `×` commutativity: `m × n = n × m`
- `×` distributivity: `(m + n) × p = p × (m + n) = m × p + n × p`

Let's sketch a couple of proofs:

-   `lunit[+] : ∀ (m ∈ ℕ). 0 + m = m`

    +   by definition: `0 + m = m`
    +   `∎`

-   `runit[+] : ∀ (m ∈ ℕ). m + 0 = m`

    +   induction on `m`
    +   case: `m=0`

        goal: `0 + 0 = 0`

        by definition

    +   case: `m=S(m′)`

        inductive hypothesis: `m′ + 0 = m′` (IH)

        goal: `S(m′) + 0 = S(m′)`

            S(m′) + 0
            = ⟅ by definition of `+` ⟆
            S(m′ + 0)
            = ⟅ by IH ⟆
            S(m′)

# Objects

So far we have studied the following language features:

- Arithmetic expressions
- Conditional expressions (booleans)
- Variables and lexical scope (let)
- First-class functions (closures)
- References and state (boxes)

An underlying theme as we studied each of these features was *orthogonality*:
each of these features (1) are as minimal as possible in the type of
functionality they provide, (2) make sense independently of all other
features, and (3) interact in a sensible way. In this way, we are now
understanding the Python program:

    x = 1
    y = x + 1
    …

as

    let x = 1 in
    let y = x + 1 in
    …

and
    x = 1
    x = x * x
    …

as

    let x = box 1 in
    let _ = x ← !x * !x
    …

That is, the features of *scope* and *mutation* are separate, orthogonal
features.

Now we will turn our attention to *object oriented programming*. First… what do
we mean by object oriented programming? This term means lots of different
things to different people. There is no single definition for the term. It is
often called a “programming paradigm”, and even *that* term doesn't have a well
agreed upon meaning. For example, here are some languages that some might call
object oriented:

- Smalltalk
- Java
- C++
- Python
- Javascript

All of these language have a different idea of what an object is, what OO
programming is, and what it isn't.

We actually have all the tools we need (in terms of the above language
features) to *encode* object oriented programs. That is, we could write a
*desugaring* operation that takes expressions in a language with object
oriented features and transforms them into expressions in a language without
such features. Or, we could give meaning to the object oriented programming
language directly, and not through desugaring. We will eventually explore both
approaches, but for now we focus on the desugaring of object oriented programs
into our current core language.

## Warmup: OO in Java and Python

Let's look at a simple class and object with methods using Java:

    class Point {
      private double x;
      private double y;
    
      public Point(double x, double y) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
      }
    
      public double getX() {
        return x;
      }
    
      public double getY() {
        return y;
      }
    
      public static void main(String[] args) {
        Point p = new Point(1.0, 2.0);
        System.out.println(p.getX());
      }
    }

and the same class and object when written in Python:

    class Point:
        def __init__(self, x, y):
          self.x = x
          self.y = y
    
        def get_x(self):
          return self.x
    
        def get_y(self):
          return self.y
    
    p = Point(1.0, 2.0)
    print(p.get_x())

### OO Concepts

Let's review some of the OO concepts and terminology, using these two
programs as a reference.

First, central to the OO paradigm is the concept of a *class*. A class is a
blueprint used to create objects, and in both Java and Python, there is a
syntactic keyword `class` for defining a class.

Next, there is the concept of a *constructor*. Constructors are special
functions which create a new *instance* of a class, and each instance of a
class is called an *object*. In Java, the constructor is defined as the
`Point(double x, double y)` function, and in Python, the constructor is defined
as the `__init__(self, x, y)` function.

Constructors typically initialize the *fields* of the object. In Java, fields
are both declared outside the constructor (`private double x`) and initialized
inside the constructor (`self.x = x`). In Python, fields do not need to be
declared, and are only initialized inside the constructor (`self.x = x`).

The functions `getX()` and `getY()` in Java, and `get_x(self)` and
`get_y(self)` in Python are called *methods*. Methods are special functions
which have access to a special variable—`this` in Java and `self` in
Python—which provides access to the current state of the object. The OO has
already introduced lots of new terminology; why stop now? Whereas *functions*
attached to objects are now called *methods*, instead of a *function call* we
now call this a *method invocation*.

Note that in Java, the variable name `this` is in scope *implicitly* in the
body of each method (including the constructor), whereas in Python it is in
scope *explicitly* in the body of each method (including the constructor), and
it is introduced into scope as the first parameter of each method.

In the main body of each program, a new `Point` object is created with initial
values `1.0` and `2.0` for the fields `x` and `y` respectively, and then the
method `getX()`/`get_x()` is called to retrieve this value, which is then
printed. Note that in Java, the method definition of `getX()` has no arguments,
and the method invocation `p.getX()` also has no arguments, whereas in Python
the method definition takes an explicit variable `self` in `get_x(self)`, but
the method invocation leaves this implicit in `p.get_x()`. Python implements
the method invocation `p.get_x()` as essentially `Point.get_x(p)`, which is how
the `self` argument in the first argument for all methods gets bound to the
object calling the method.

### Semantics Concepts

Now, let's map the semantics concepts we've seen in this class so far onto the
above Java and Python programs:

- There is a strong notion of scope: e.g., in the Java constructor, `this.x`
  references the *private field* `x`, whereas `x` references the *function
  parameter* `x`. The scope for `this` in Java is a little more nebulous. Where
  is it bound, and what is its scope?
- There is some implicit scoping going on: e.g., in the Java methods `getX` and
  `getY` the variable references `x` and `y` are implicitly `this.x` and
  `this.y` because there is no “closer” binding for those names in scope (as
  opposed to the constructor).
- A more subtle feature is the notion of “data encapsulation”. That is, the
  object fields `x`, `y` and `z` are marked as `private`, meaning that any code
  that interacts with this object is only allowed to call its methods, and are
  not allowed to access `z`. We actually *have* seen “data encapsulation”
  before with closures, which keep around data, but the only way to access this
  data is through functions which capture the environment. E.g.:

        let f = 
          let x = 1 in
          fun _ => x
        in <blah>

  In this program, <blah> has access to `f`, which when called, will return
  `x`, however `x` is no longer in scope, and therefore no longer accessible
  directly.
- The behavior of methods is very similar to the behavior of functions, which
  we have already studied. In fact, methods which take parameters will be
  modeled in our core language as just "normal" functions.

The one thing that we have *not* seen so far is name-based access of a value.
For example:

    Point p = new Point(2, 3);
    return p.getX();

This program returns the value `2`. 

Another new thing we haven't seen before is the access that methods have to the
`this` or `self` variable, which is a reference to the object from which the
method was called.

These two new features are the ones we will imbue into our core language: (1)
field/method access like `p.getX`, and (2) implicit (or explicit) binding of
`this`/`self` variable. We will introduce these features through the
traditional concept of a “class” from object oriented programming, and will
look at how to split these into more orthogonal concepts in the future.

## Core Language Features for Objects

Let's start with an encoding of the point object in our new core language,
written using the language features we have seen thus far, as well as new
features for OO programming:

    let Point = 
          class
          fields x y
          method get-x => !self.x
          method get-y => !self.y
          method set-x => fun x => self.x <- x
          method set-y => fun y => self.y <- y
          method norm-sq => self.get-x * self.get-x + self.get-y * self.get-y
          end
    in
    let p = new Point { x = 1, y = 2 } in 
    p.norm-sq

Here is how this program works: First, a new *class* is created using the
syntax `class fields … method … method … end`. The `class … end` expression
returns a *class value*, which is bound to the variable name Point using just a
normal let-binding. *Class values* essentially just record the information
about the class: the fields and methods. Next, a new `Point` object is created
using the `new Point { … }` syntax. This syntax acts as a call to a fixed,
default constructor which cannot be overridden, as is the case in Java and
Python. We could add support for custom constructors/initializers later if we
want, but it's not necessary for the core functionality of OO functionality.
The syntax `new Point { … }` creates an *object value*. This object value knows
that its fields `x` and `y` are assigned to values `1` and `2`. Because we want
to be able to change the values of these fields (e.g., using the `set-x`
method), the object value doesn't map field names to *values*, rather it maps
field names to *locations*, and the values associated with these locations can
be manipulated in the store using the same mutation language features we just
studied in HW07. Finally, `p.norm-sq` is a *method call*. This method call
looks up the method named `norm-sq` and runs the body of the method, but with a
new binding in its environment: a mapping from the variable `self` to the
object used to call the method, in this case `p`.

The field/method accessor syntax is `e.x` and it is overloaded: if `x` refers
to a field name, then the meaning of the operator is to return the *location*
of the field's value, and if `x` both doesn't refer to a field name and does
refer to a method name, then the meaning of the operator is to call the method.
Notice that methods of no arguments take no arguments and there are no parens
`()` to say there are no arguments. Methods of more than one argument are easy
to implement by returning functions in the body of the zero-argument method. In
the `Point` class above, `get-x` and `get-y` are zero-argument methods, and
`set-x` and `set-y` are conceptually one-argument methods, encoded as a
zero-argument method that returns a one-argument function.

So we have three new syntactic forms for creating classes, creating objects,
and referencing fields/methods:

    e ∈ expr ⩴ …
             | class fields x … x [method x => e] … [method x => e] end
             | new e { x = e , … , x = e }
             | e.x

A note on this syntax for describing syntax: 

    [method x => e] … [method x => e]

This means 0 or more occurrences of the syntax `method x => e`. The square
brackets are not part of the syntax we are describing, but a grouping operator
that says the `…` is referring to the whole chunk of syntax `method x => e`.

We also have two new values: class values and object values:

    v ∈ value ⩴ …
              | ⟨class fields x … x [method x => e] … [method x => e] end, γ⟩
              | ⟨object fields {x ↦ ℓ , … , x ↦ ℓ} methods {x ↦ e , … , x ↦ e}, γ⟩

Notice that like closure values we introduce in HW06, both class and object
values contain a closure environment. This is because the class creation
expression can appear as an arbitrary subexpression, and when evaluating this
subexpression, there may be free variables in that expression which are given
meaning by the current environment. Like function closures, we capture this
environment at class creation time, and reinstate this environment whenever
we need to interpret one of the method bodies inside the class declaration
(e.g, when interpreting a method call). Here is an example that demonstrates
this capability:

    let offset-x = 10 in
    let offset-y = 100 in
    let Point = 
          class
          fields x y
          method get-x => !self.x
          method get-y => !self.y
          method norm-sq =>
            let x = offset-x + self.get-x in
            let y = offset-y + self.get-y in
            x * x + y * y
          end
    in
    let offset-x = 20 in
    let offset-y = 200 in
    let p = new MyClass { x = 1, y = 2 } in 
    p.norm-sq

Here there are local variable `offset-x` and `offset-y` which are in scope when
the `Point` class is created. These offsets are added to the points local `x`
and `y` values when computing the “non-offset” norm of the point. Rather than
have let-bindings for `offset-x` and `offset-y`, we could create a function
which creates a new `Point` class based on any offset and have the same effect.
After the `Point` class is created, new let-bindings are created for the
variable names `offset-x` and `offset-y` with values `20` and `200`. These
*shadow* the earlier bindings, and the references to `offset-x` and `offset-y`
in the class definition should not see them; they should see the initial
bindings to `10` and `100`. When the method `norm-sq` is invoked from some
`Point` object, we have to “remember” the environment that existed when the
class was created---exactly like a function closure!

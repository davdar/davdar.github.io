[18 - Program Analysis I](#title)

# Program Analysis I

## Context

Until now we've only seen *standard* interpreters: interpreters that map input
programs to a final value. We are going turn our attention to *program
analyzers*: programs that map input programs to *some useful information about
the final value.* This useful information is usually *less* precise than the
final value reported by the interpreter, and there are good reasons to want
this. 

The main reason to want a program analyzer that computes less information than
the standard interpreter is efficiency, also called *tractability*. If a
particular program takes an hour to run, we may want our analyzer to only take
a few seconds, or a few minutes, and give us some insight as to what would
happen if we ran the full “simulation” using the standard interpreter. More
fundamentally, it's not actually possible to fully simulate all programs. The
famous Halting Problem says that we can't always determine algorithmically
whether or not a given program (written in Turing Complete language) will
terminate or not. Without knowing that a program terminates or not, running it
in the standard interpreter is somewhat of a gamble. Consider this program:

    let x = f 100 in
    if x⋖10
      then [bad stuff happens]
      else [good stuff happens]

We may want to know if the call to `f 100` will return a number less than 10 or
not, because then we know if `[bad stuff happens]` or not. Can we just run `f
100` and see what it returns? What if it hangs for 1 hour? What if for 1 day,
or 1 year? What if it never returns (it loops forever)? It's going to be hard
to tell these situations apart using the standard interpreter (in fact it's
impossible to do so in general!) so we are going to turn the question around.
Rather than ask “how can we use a standard interpreter to answer questions
about how a program will behave?” we will ask “given a behavior we are
interested in, how can we design a program analyzer that will compute an
*approximation* of the answer to the question we are interested in?”

A basic example of a useful analysis is interval analysis. If I have a program
that accesses arrays with integer indices, I may want to know if all of the
array accesses will be in bounds, and I may want to know this before running
the program in full. I don't necessarily care what the exact value of array
indices are, I just care if they are in bounds. A common representation to use
for arithmetic programs is called the “interval abstract domain.” In this
approach, instead of interpreting using numbers, we instead use a range of
numbers between some lower bound `a` and some upper bound `b` (inclusive),
commonly written as `[a,b]` in math. We want to design our analyzers such that
when they run a program and return something like `[2,10]`, then we know that
when the program is run, it is guaranteed to produce integer results between
`2` and `10`.

The idea behind abstract interpretation is that we “interpret” the program
using symbolic, or approximate representations for values. Do do this, we need
to define implementation of operations (like plus and if) which take as input
these approximate results, and return as output another approximate result.
Each of these operators must consider all possible concrete inputs which the
approximate inputs *represent* and produce an output which is an upper bound on
the set of possible outputs. This connection between analysis results and
“possible concrete results” is made through a formal interpretation of
approximate values. We notate this interpretation of possible values as `⟦_⟧`.
Note the syntax is now becoming very overloaded, so `⟦e⟧` as notation can mean
the interpretation of a program, and `⟦v̂⟧` as notation can mean the
interpretation of an abstract value. E.g., for ranges, `⟦[a,b]⟧` is the
interpretation of the range `[a,b]` and is equal to the set of numbers between
`a` and `b`, so  `⟦[a,b]⟧ ≜ {i : a ≤ i ≤ b}`.

In designing a program analyzer via abstract interpretation, the approach goes
as follows:
- define approximate *representations* for concrete values (like integers)
- define approximate *implementations* for operations (like plus)
- convert the standard interpreter to work over approximations instead of
  concrete values
As we play this game, we place “hats” on things to denote
“approximate-version-of”, e.g., `î ∈ ℤ̂` means “an approximate integer `î` is in
the set of approximate integers `ℤ̂`. This is a notational trick to avoid having
to come up with new names for everything. `X̂` is just an abstract form of `X`,
and conceptually the interpretation of the abstraction `⟦X̂⟧` represents a set
of possible `X`s.

## Approximate Booleans

Booleans are easy to approximate because there are a finite number of
them–there are exactly two.

### Abstract Domain

We represent a set of possible booleans as literally a set of possible
booleans:

    b̂ ∈ 𝔹̂ ≜ ℘(𝔹)

the interpretation of abstract booleans is not interesting–it is the identity
mapping:

    ⟦_⟧ ∈ 𝔹̂ → ℘(𝔹)
    ⟦b̂⟧ ≜ b̂

## Abstract Operations

What operations do we support on booleans? The primary one is the conditional:
`IF`. Let's consider three types of programs which now appear in our “abstract
semantics” (aka program analyzer):

    if b̂₁ then b̂₂ else b̂₃

1. when `b̂₁ = ∅`
2. when `b̂₁ = {true}`
3. when `b̂₁ = {true,false}`

In (1), we have analyzed the guard `b̂₁` and determined that there are no
possible values that it could compute (e.g., either due to a runtime error, or
an infinite loop). The result of analyzing the conditional is then also `∅`,
indicating that there are no possible results.

In (2), we have analyzed the guard `b̂₁` and determined that there is exactly
one possible value that it could be: `true`. The result of analyzing the
conditional is then `b̂₂`, because this is the branch that would be taken in the
standard interpreter.

In (3), we have analyzed the guard and determined that it could return *either
true or false*. In this case, the set of possible results is `b̂₂ ∪ b̂₃`—any of
the booleans that the true branch could return, or any of the booleans that the
false branch could return.

The implementation of the conditional (when both branches return possible
booleans) is then:

    ĉond ∈ 𝔹̂ × 𝔹̂ × 𝔹̂ → 𝔹̂
    ĉond(b̂₁,b̂₂,b̂₃) ≜ 
      { b̂₂ | true ∈ b̂₁ }
      ∪
      { b̂₃ | false ∈ b̂₁ }

## Approximate Integers

Integers are slightly harder to approximate.  First, there are an infinite
number of integers, so it would be hopeless to try to compute the set of
possible integers a program could return. E.g., consider this while loop where
we don't know the value of `x` (although we assume it is non-negative):

    i ≔ 0;
    while (i ≤ x) { i++; }

This program could return any positive integer, and there is no way to
represent this as a literal, constructed set of integers.

Second, even if we picked large and small integers as the “maximum” and
“minimum” possible integer, it would still be highly inefficient to keep around
the set of all possible integers that a program could compute. E.g., in the
same while program as before, constructing a huge set of possible integers is
still undesirable (even if possible).

### Abstract Domain

A solution to this problem is to consider ranges of possible integers,
represented by a pair of the lower bound and upper bound. We will extend the
lower-bound with negative infinity, and extend the upper bound with positive
infinity:

    î ∈ ℤ̂ ≜ ({-∞} ⊎ ℤ) × (ℤ ⊎ {+∞})

which can also be written:

    i ∈ ℤ
    lb ∈ LB ⩴ -∞ | i
    ub ∈ UB ⩴ i | +∞
    î ∈ ℤ̂ ⩴ [lb,ub]

the interpretation of abstract integers is the set of integers within the
range, with unbounded sets when one of the bounds is infinite:

    ⟦_⟧ ∈ ℤ̂ → ℘(ℤ)
    ⟦[-∞,+∞]⟧ ≜ ℤ
    ⟦[-∞,i]⟧ ≜ {j | j ≤ i}
    ⟦[i,+∞]⟧ ≜ {j | j ≥ i}
    ⟦[i,k]⟧ ≜ {j | i ≤ j ≤ k}

### Abstract Operators

Next we need to define two types of operators:
1. how to *compute* (e.g., plus) over abstract integers (intervals)
2. how to *merge* two abstract integer results (e.g., when merging the results
   of both branches of an `if`)

Merging abstract results must always be defined for abstract domains because it
is often the case that you need to represent “either A or B could happen” due
to the fact that we no longer know exactly what values will flow through the
program. E.g.:

    b̂ ≜ {true,false}
    if b̂ then [1,2] else [4,5]

In this program we are analyzing a program fragment where (1) we know that the
guard could evaluate to either true or false (2) we know the true branch could
evaluate to either `1` or `2`, and (3) we know that the false branch could
evaluate to either `4` or `5`. What are the possible results of this program
fragment? A precise characterization is the set `{1,2,4,5}`, but we are
choosing to represent these sets as ranges for practical reasons, so an
“optimal” abstract result for this program would be `[1,5]` because it's the
tightest interval that includes the actual set of possible results.

*ASIDE: precision and optimality are different notions in program analysis. A
precise interval would be one that represents the set `{1,2,4,5}`, but we
cannot achieve with a single interval. An optimal interval is one that
represents some set larger equal or larger than `{1,2,4,5}`, and for which a
better representation does not exist. `[1,5]` is technically optimal, because
there is no better interval, but it is not precise. In this specific sense.
(The choice of words “precise” and “optimal” is precise, but not necessarily
optimal.)*

The “merging” operation is pronounced “join” and notated `⊔`. This symbol
intentionally looks close to the set union symbol `∪`, which is a good
intuition for how it should behave. Join for intervals looks like this:

    _⊔_ ∈ ℤ̂ × ℤ̂ → ℤ̂
    [lb₁,ub₁] ⊔ [lb₂,ub₂] ≜ [min(lb₁,lb₂),max(ub₁,ub₂)]

One small technicality is the fact that `lb` and `ub` could be negative or
positive infinity, but we interpret `min` and `max` on this extended set of
integers in the obvious way (`-∞` is smaller than everything else, and `+∞` is
bigger than everything else).

Another small technicality is the fact that one of the ranges could be *empty*,
e.g., in `[2,1]`. If we assume ranges could be empty, we can do better than the
above definition. E.g., because `[2,1]` represents the empty set of integers,
when you “join” this interval with another one, you should just leave the other
interval untouched. That is, we want `[2,1] ⊔ [100,200]` to be `[100,200]`, not
`[2,200]`. An “optimal” definition is then:

    _⊔_ ∈ ℤ̂ × ℤ̂ → ℤ̂
    î₁        ⊔ î₂        ≜ î₂                           if  ⟦î₁⟧ = ∅
    î₁        ⊔ î₂        ≜ î₁                           if  ⟦î₂⟧ = ∅
    [lb₁,ub₁] ⊔ [lb₂,ub₂] ≜ [min(lb₁,lb₂),max(ub₁,ub₂)]  if  ⟦[lb₁,ub₁]⟧ ≠ ∅  and  ⟦[lb₂,ub₂]⟧ ≠ ∅

Next we want to define operations over intervals, like plus. First, let's work
through some examples. What do we expect the abstract results to look like for
these programs:

    [1,2] +̂ [3,4]
    [1,4] +̂ [2,3]
    [1,3] +̂ [2,4]
    [-1,1] +̂ [-2,2]
    [2,1] +̂ [100,200]

We expect the results to look like this:

    [1,2] +̂ [3,4] = [4,6]
    [1,4] +̂ [2,3] = [3,7]
    [1,3] +̂ [2,4] = [3,7]
    [-1,1] +̂ [-2,2] = [-3,3]
    [2,1] +̂ [100,200] = [2,1]

How did we come up with those? The formula is simply to add the lower bounds,
and add the upper bounds.  In the last case, the idea is that if one of the
ranges is empty, then there are no numbers that it represents, and likewise
there are no numbers that could be produced by the plus.

    [lb₁,ub₁] +̂ [lb₂,ub₂] ≜ ∅                  if  ⟦[lb₁,ub₁]⟧ = ∅  or   ⟦[lb₁,ub₁]⟧ = ∅
    [lb₁,ub₁] +̂ [lb₂,ub₂] ≜ [lb₁+lb₂,ub₁+ub₂]  if  ⟦[lb₁,ub₁]⟧ ≠ ∅  and  ⟦[lb₁,ub₁]⟧ ≠ ∅

The above definitions for join `⊔` and abstract plus `+̂` have revealed an
unsatisfactory property of our abstract representation: it isn't *canonical*. A
canonical representation is one where no two different representations have the
exact same meaning. Because `⟦[2,1]⟧ = ⟦[3,2]⟧ = ⟦[3,1]⟧ = ∅` and so on, we
don't have a canonical representation. We could pick one of these as the
*distinguished* empty interval, or we could add a new element to our
abstraction to represent the empty interval, and disallow empty ranges. Here is
what that looks like:

    î ∈ ℤ̂ ≃ {⊥} ⊎ {(lb,ub) | lb ∈ {-∞} ⊎ ℤ, ub ∈ ℤ ⊎ {+∞}, lb ≤ ub} 

which can also be written:

    i ∈ ℤ
    lb ∈ LB ⩴ -∞ | i
    ub ∈ UB ⩴ i | +∞
    î ∈ ℤ̂ ⩴ ⊥ | [lb,ub]  where  lb ≤ ub

This says that an abstract integer `î` is either literally the symbol `⊥`, or
it's an interval `[lb,ub]` (with `lb ∈ LB` and `ub ∈ UB`) with the constraint
that `lb ≤ ub`. Interpretation is then:

    ⟦_⟧ ∈ ℤ̂ → ℘(ℤ)
    ⟦⊥⟧ ≜ ∅
    ⟦[-∞,+∞]⟧ = ℤ
    ⟦[-∞,i]⟧ = {j | j ≤ i}
    ⟦[i,+∞]⟧ = {j | j ≥ i}
    ⟦[i,k]⟧ = {j | i ≤ j ≤ k}

and join is now defined:

    _⊔_ ∈ ℤ̂ × ℤ̂ → ℤ̂
    ⊥         ⊔ î₂        ≜ î₂
    î₁        ⊔ ⊥         ≜ î₁
    [lb₁,ub₁] ⊔ [lb₂,ub₂] ≜ [min(lb₁,lb₂),max(ub₁,ub₂)]

and plus:

    _+̂_ ∈ ℤ̂ × ℤ̂ → ℤ̂
    ⊥  +̂ î₂ ≜ ⊥
    i₁ +̂ ⊥  ≜ ⊥
    [lb₁,ub₁] +̂ [lb₂,ub₂] ≜ [lb₁+lb₂,ub₁+ub₂]

Notice there are no more side-conditions. This will make the definition easier
to implement. Also notice that, before we introduced the new element `⊥`, it
may have been tempting to just define plus as:

    _+̂_ ∈ ℤ̂ × ℤ̂ → ℤ̂
    [lb₁,ub₁] +̂ [lb₂,ub₂] ≜ [lb₁+lb₂,ub₁+ub₂]

But this would have been non-optimal. Having a *canonical* representation often
helps catch non-optimal definitions like the one above.

## Approximate Values and Answers

Now that we have defined join and plus for abstract integers, we need to decide
how to represent abstract values and answers (`maybe(value)`), and how to
perform operations on those representations. We are going to not worry about
the interpreter environment or store right now, and pretend we are working in a
simple interpreter setup like:

    ⟦_⟧ ∈ expr → maybe(value)

### Abstract Domain

We start from the intuition that an abstract value should represent a set of
concrete values. Because concrete values are either integers or booleans, we
can pretend instead that values come from the set of “integers or booleans”
which is formed by a disjoint union: `ℤ ⊎ 𝔹`. Abstract values are
then *conceptually* defined as:

    value ≃ ℤ ⊎ 𝔹
    v̂alue ≈ ℘(ℤ ⊎ 𝔹)

now we are going to rely on a correspondence between the algebra of numbers and
the algebra of sets, and a basic fact about numbers. First, the cardinality
(number of elements, written `|X|`) of set-level connectives is mirrored by
numeric operations:

    |A ⊎ B| = |A| + |B|
    |A × B| = |A| * |B|
    |A → B| = |B|^|A|
    |℘(A)| = 2^|A|

The formula from powersets is a happy coincidence with powersets `X ∈ A` being
isomorphic to characteristic functions `φ ∈ A → 𝔹`. So a powerset `℘(A)` is the
same set as a function into bool `A → 𝔹`, and the cardinality rule for that
function type gives `|A → 𝔹| = |𝔹|^|A| = 2^|A|`.

A basic property of numbers is that:

    2ᵃ⁺ᵇ = 2ᵃ2ᵇ

and in the land of sets, this establishes an isomorphism between `℘(A⊎B)` and
`℘(A)×℘(B)`. An example of this isomorphism is that these two English
statements are equivalent:

> Tell me all of the vegetables you either ate *or* didn't eat over the weekend.

> Tell me all of the vegetables you ate over the weekend, *and* tell me all of the vegetables you didn't eat over the weekend.

We use this isomorphism to split `℘(ℤ ⊎ 𝔹)` into an equivalent set `℘(ℤ) ×
℘(𝔹)`. We now must choose how to represent sets of integers (we will do this
using `ℤ̂` defined above), and how to represent sets of booleans (we will do
this using `𝔹̂` defined above).

An abstract value is then:

    v̂ ∈ v̂alue ≜ ℤ̂ × 𝔹̂ ⩴ ⟨î,b̂⟩

Abstract values have their own definition for “no values” (written `⊥` and
pronounced “bottom”) and “combine results” (notated `⊔` and pronounced “join”).

    ⊥ ∈ v̂alue
    ⊥ = ⟨⊥,∅⟩

    _⊔_ ∈ v̂alue × v̂alue → v̂alue
    ⟨î₁,b̂₁⟩ ⊔ ⟨î₂,b̂₂⟩ ≜ ⟨î₁⊔î₂,b̂₁∪b̂₂⟩

We extend this idea to abstract answers, starting from the definition of concrete answers:

    a ∈ answer ≜ {bad} ⊎ v̂alue = {bad} ⊎ ℤ ⊎ 𝔹

and for its abstraction we arrive at:

    â ∈ ânswer ≜ 𝔹 × v̂alue ⩴ ⟨b,v̂⟩

where the boolean is a flag as to whether or not the program could fail (could
return `bad`). There is one element in `{bad}`, and there are two elements in
`℘({bad})`, so we may as well just represent this two element set as a bool.

    |{bad}| = 1
    |℘({bad})| = 2^1 = 2
    |𝔹| = 2

For answers:

    ⊥ ∈ ânswer
    ⊥ = ⟨false,⊥⟩

    _⊔_ ∈ ânswer × ânswer → ânswer
    ⟨b₁,v̂₁⟩ ⊔ ⟨b₂,v̂₂⟩ = ⟨b₁∨b₂,v̂₁⊔v̂₂⟩

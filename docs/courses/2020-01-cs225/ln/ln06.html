[06 - Syntax ⅋ Interpretation](#title)

**Much of this material is drawn from Shriram Krishnamurthi's book:**
[Programming Languages: Application and Interpretation][PLAI].

# Syntax

There is a difference between each of these terms:
- A string (sequence of characters)
- “concrete syntax”
- “abstract syntax”

An example of a string is `I love my dog` or even `la6ki4faj2fsaf`---a string
is just a collection of symbols.

“Concrete syntax” is a *well-formed* string in the syntax of some language,
e.g., `23 + 5 - 6`. Concrete syntax is what you interface with when you write
and manipulate programs in a text editor. 

Concrete syntax is often designed to be lightweight, intuitive, and easy to
read. To do this, the way in which the string is “parsed” is often left
implicit, e.g., `23 + 5 - 6` is parsed (based on convention) as `(23 + 5) - 6`
and `23 + 5 × 6` is parsed as `23 + (5 × 6)`.

A well-designed language will have a well-defined spec for which strings are
valid concrete syntax, including how ambiguities are handled such as operator
precedence.

Although we manipulate syntax as strings, what a term in a programming language
*is* is a tree of symbols.

    23 + 5 × 6
    ≈
      +
     / \
    23  ×
       / \
      5   6

“Abstract syntax” is a machine-friendly datatype representation of the
underlying syntax tree. For example, the concrete syntax `23 + 5 × 6` is
“parsed” into the abstract syntax `Plus 23 (Times 5 6)`. Abstract syntax makes
the *tree*-structure of syntax explicit, resolves ambiguities, and typically
maps directly to a datatype in some programming language.

*Aside:* The syntax of Lisp was designed to unify concrete and abstract syntax.
E.g., `(+ 23 (× 5 6))` is *both* the user-facing concrete syntax, as well as
the representation of its self as data. This design is advantageous because it
removes any form of syntactic ambiguity from the concrete syntax (what does `24
/ 5 × 8` mean?) and it makes support for macro meta-programming easier. All of
the examples in the book use Lisp syntax (called “S-expressions”). To read a
lisp term, translate `(+ 1 2)` in your head to `1 + 2` and `(f x y)` to
`f(x,y)`.

# Interpreters

An interpreter is a function `interp ∈ expr → value`. Let's start with the
simplest programming language we can think of: simple arithmetic expressions.

    (1 + 2) × 3
    1 + (2 × 3)
    1 + (2 × (3 + 4))

As a general rule, expressions can nest arbitrarily. There are three ways to
create expressions, like a syntax “schema”:

    i ∈ ℤ
    e ∈ expr ⩴ i
             | e + e
             | e × e

We are going to write an interpreter `interp` for `expr` in two phases: (1)
write tests for the interpreter, and then (2) write the interpreter.

*Tests:*

    interp( (1 + 2) × 3       ) = 9
    interp( 1 + (2 × 3)       ) = 7
    interp( 1 + (2 × (3 + 4)) ) = 15

*The Interpreter:*

    interp(i)       ≜ i
    interp(e₁ + e₂) ≜ interp(e₁) + interp(e₂)
    interp(e₁ × e₂) ≜ interp(e₁) × interp(e₂)

alternatively, using “tree syntax”:

    interp(i)       ≜ i
          ╭   +   ╮
    interp│  / \  │ ≜ interp(e₁) + interp(e₂)
          ╰ e₁ e₂ ╯
          ╭   ×   ╮
    interp│  / \  │ ≜ interp(e₁) × interp(e₂)
          ╰ e₁ e₂ ╯
       

alternatively, using “abstract syntax”:

    interp(Nat(i))       ≜ i
    interp(Plus(e₁,e₂))  ≜ interp(e₁) + interp(e₂)
    interp(Times(e₁,e₂)) ≜ interp(e₁) × interp(e₂)

in Haskell syntax:

    interp (Nat i)       = i
    interp (Plus e₁ e₂)  = interp e₁ + interp e₂
    interp (Times e₁ e₂) = interp e₂ × interp e₂

Note that the `+` in the left-hand-side of each definition is syntax, and the
`+` in right-hand-side of each definition is math.

# Desugaring

There are two ways to add a new feature to a programming language:

1. Give meaning to the feature via interpretation function
2. Give meaning to the feature based on existing features

(2) is done through a process called “desugaring”. Some features in programming
languages do not increase the expressive power of the language. For example,
because our language has addition and multiplication, it is possible to encode
subtraction through a combination of addition and multiplication with `-1`.

    x - y = x + (-1) × y

We now have *three* objects of interest: the “source” language (the language
which includes subtraction), the “core” language (the language with just plus
and multiplication), and the “domain” of interpretation (integers).

Formally, our source language now looks like this:

    eₛ ∈ sexpr ⩴ i
              | eₛ + eₛ
              | eₛ × eₛ
              | eₛ - eₛ

our core language looks like this:

    e ∈ cexpr ⩴ i
              | e + e
              | e × e

and our domain of interpretation looks like this:

    v ∈ value ⩴ i

The desugaring of subtraction is a recursive traversal of the term:

    desugar ∈ sexp → cexp
    desugar(i) ≜ i
    desugar(eₛ₁ + eₛ₂) ≜ desugar(eₛ₁) + desugar(eₛ₂)
    desugar(eₛ₁ × eₛ₂) ≜ desugar(eₛ₁) × desugar(eₛ₂)
    desugar(eₛ₁ - eₛ₂) ≜ desugar(eₛ₁) + (-1) × desugar(eₛ₂)

Note that the right-hand-side is syntax, not math.

The interpreter is the same as before:

    interp ∈ cexp → value
    interp(i) ≜ i
    interp(e₁ + e₂) ≜ interp(e₁) + interp(e₂)
    interp(e₁ × e₂) ≜ interp(e₁) × interp(e₂)

Q: how would you encode unary negation?

    e ∈ sexpr ⩴ i
              | eₛ + eₛ
              | eₛ × eₛ
              | eₛ - eₛ
              | neg eₛ

    desugar ∈ sexp → cexp
    𝟏 ?? desugar(neg eₛ) ≜ 0 - desugar(eₛ)
    𝟐 ?? desugar(neg eₛ) ≜ desugar(0 - eₛ)
    𝟑 ?? desugar(neg eₛ) ≜ (-1) × desugar(eₛ)

The 3rd solution is the “preferred” one. The 2nd one works. The 1st one doesn't
work. (why not??)

# Review

Let's play the scope game. Work together in groups. Identify each of these:

1. Circle binders
2. Draw a bracket for each scope with an incoming arrow from its binder
3. Draw an arrow from each variable reference to its binder
4. Draw a square around every free variable

for the following terms:

1. `let x = x in x`
2. `let x = y in let y = x in x`
3. `let x = let y = x in x in x`

# Conditionals and Effects

In prior classes and homework we had boolean operations in our language like
disjunction and conjunction.

    e ‚©¥ ‚Ä¶ | e || e | e && e

A universal boolean operation is the conditional:

       guard         second branch
       ‚Üì             ‚Üì
    if e then e else e
              ‚Üë
              first branch

where boolean operations like logical disjunction, conjunction and negation are
encoded as:

    e‚ÇÅ || e‚ÇÇ ‚âú if e‚ÇÅ then true else e‚ÇÇ
    e‚ÇÅ && e‚ÇÇ ‚âú if e‚ÇÇ then e‚ÇÅ else false
    not e‚ÇÅ   ‚âú if e‚ÇÅ the false else true

However, the semantics of this conditional are slightly different than all of
the primitive operations we have seen so far, such as plus, times, logical or,
etc. The idea behind a conditionals is that if the guard evaluates to true then
the first branch is evaluated, and if the guard evaluates to false then the
second branch is evaluated. So either the first or second branch is evaluated,
but not both. This is different from e.g., plus (`e + e`) where both arguments
are always fully evaluated.

The first consequence of this is an efficiency gain: if we only execute one
branch, we don't waste our time evaluating the second branch which will just
get thrown out. For this reason, most languages implement ‚Äúshort-circuiting‚Äù
boolean operations, where `e‚ÇÅ || e‚ÇÇ` doesn't execute `e‚ÇÇ` if `e‚ÇÅ` evaluates to
`true`, and `e‚ÇÅ && e‚ÇÇ` doesn't execute `e‚ÇÇ` if `e‚ÇÅ` evaluates to false.

The second consequence of this has to do with *computational effects*.
Computational effects are things that break substitution-based reasoning.
Consider the program:

    true || (1 + false)

In a short-circuiting evaluation this will return `true`, and otherwise it will
fail (return `bad`). You can see this more clearly in its encoding using `if`:

    if true then true else 1 + false

Here, failure is an ‚Äúeffect‚Äù, meaning it can change the meaning of a program
that is sensitive to whether or not the term is executed or not. You can see
effects also in programs that bind variables which aren't used:

    let x = 1 + false in 5

What should this program mean? Both `5` and `bad` are perfectly good answers,
and neither is best. The evaluation strategy that results in `5` is called
‚Äúcall-by-name‚Äù (or ‚Äúcall-by-need‚Äù) and the one that results in `bad` is called
‚Äúcall-by-value‚Äù. Call-by-name is generally speaking less efficient.

Other types of effects are things like failure (exceptions), printing (IO),
changing the value of a variable (mutation) and looping forever
(nontermination). If a term has no effects, then the meaning of a program under
call-by-name and call-by-value evaluation coincide.

# Environments

Last time we talked about *scope*, and algorithms `WF` and `FV` which compute
whether or not a term is well-formed, and the free variables of a term
respectively. Let's remind ourselves about the well-formed algorithm:

    WF ‚àà ‚Ñò(var) √ó expr ‚Üí ùîπ
    WF(S,i) ‚âú true
    WF(S,e‚ÇÅ + e‚ÇÇ) ‚âú WF(S,e‚ÇÅ) ‚àß WF(S,e‚ÇÇ)
    WF(S,e‚ÇÅ * e‚ÇÇ) ‚âú WF(S,e‚ÇÅ) ‚àß WF(S,e‚ÇÇ)
    WF(S,x) ‚âú x ‚àà S
    WF(S,let x = e‚ÇÅ in e‚ÇÇ) ‚âú WF(S,e‚ÇÅ) ‚àß WF(S‚à™{x},e‚ÇÇ)

The last line indicates that a let is well-formed in scope `S` when its body is
well-formed in the scope`S‚à™{x}`.

This well-formedness analysis is an instance of ‚Äústatic semantics‚Äú‚Äîit's an
approximation of behavior that exists in the ‚Äúdynamic semantics‚Äù of the
programming language, which is the runtime behavior of programs, and in our
case so far, the interpreter for the language. Sometimes we design static
semantics as an approximation of dynamic semantics, and sometimes we define
dynamic semantics as a refinement of static semantics. In this case, we will at
least observe the shared structure between `WF` and the interpretation of
variable binding and environments (the dynamic analog of scope).

    Œ≥ ‚àà env ‚âú var ‚áÄ value
    interp ‚àà env √ó expr ‚Üí answer
    interp(Œ≥,i) ‚âú i
    interp(Œ≥,e‚ÇÅ + e‚ÇÇ) ‚âú i‚ÇÅ + i‚ÇÇ
      where i‚ÇÅ = interp(Œ≥,e‚ÇÅ)
            i‚ÇÇ = interp(Œ≥,e‚ÇÇ)
    interp(Œ≥,e‚ÇÅ * e‚ÇÇ) ‚âú i‚ÇÅ * i‚ÇÇ
      where i‚ÇÅ = interp(Œ≥,e‚ÇÅ)
            i‚ÇÇ = interp(Œ≥,e‚ÇÇ)
    interp(Œ≥,x) ‚âú Œ≥(x)
    interp(Œ≥,let x = e‚ÇÅ in e‚ÇÇ) ‚âú interp(Œ≥‚Ä≤,e‚ÇÇ)
      where Œ≥‚Ä≤ = Œ≥[x‚Ü¶v]
            v = interp(Œ≥,e‚ÇÅ)

This interpreter is *call-by-value* because the environment maps variables
to values. To get a *call-by-name* interpreter, the environment would map
variables to unevaluated terms, and the last two lines would look like this:

    interp(Œ≥,x) ‚âú interp(Œ≥(x))
    interp(Œ≥,let x = e‚ÇÅ in e‚ÇÇ) ‚âú interp(Œ≥‚Ä≤,e‚ÇÇ)
      where Œ≥‚Ä≤ = Œ≥[x‚Ü¶e‚ÇÅ]

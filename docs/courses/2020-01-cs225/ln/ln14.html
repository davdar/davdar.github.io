[14 - Mutation I](#title)

# Mutation

We will now turn out attention to these types of programs:

    x = 1;
    y = x + 2;
    x = 3;
    z = x + 2;
    return y + z;

You are probably used to thinking about this program as:

1. a “box” for each of the variables `x`, `y` and `z`.
2. each statement changes the boxes
3. `return` is a special command that says “this is the result”

We are going to study this program in a more explicit form:

    let x = box 1 in
    let y = box (!x + 2) in
    x ← 3 ;
    let z = box (!x + 2) in
    !y + !z

there are four new syntactic forms features at work here:

- (1) `box e` creates a new box where the initial contents is the value resulting
   in evaluating `e`.
- (2) `!e` returns the value that currently lives inside the box that `e`
   evaluates to.
- (3) `e₁ ← e₂` takes the box that is returned by `e₁` and updates its value to be
   result of evaluating `e₂`.
- (4) `e₁ ; e₂` means “perform the actions in `e₁` and discard the
   result, then evaluate `e₂`”. This functionality is easy to simulate using a
   let binding with a dummy variable: `let _ = e₁ in e₂`. So wherever we see
   `e₁ ; e₂` in an example or test case, the formal meaning is in terms of let,
   and the parser desugars the semicolon notation into the let form.

Notice that we are being very precise about three distinct, orthogonal concepts:

1. The *variables* `x`, `y` and `z`.
2. The *values* `1`, `2` and  `3`.
3. The *boxes* that (a) each variable is bound to, and (b) the value inside of
   each box. *Both (a) and (b) never change.* It is the contents of each box
   that changes.

Also notice that the syntax for assignment is `e₁ ← e₂`. *assignment is
unrelated from variable scope; assignment is about boxes, which are runtime
values, and `e₁` here is not a variable name, but an expression that evaluates
to a box*. Variables and binders are *static*: you can always point to a
variable's binder without running it. Boxes are *dynamic*: you may not know
what box something points to, or if two things point to the same box, until you
run the program.

A special power of programming with boxes is the ability to *alias* boxes.

    let x = box 1 in
    let y = x in
    y ← 4 ;
    !x

This program evaluates to 4 in the following steps: it creates a new box with 1
inside it, introduces a *new name* (y) for the *same box* (the one with 1
inside), updates the box through the new name, and then dereferences the box
through the old name. This is analogous to the following C program:

    int *x;
    x = malloc(1 * sizeof(int));
    *x = 1;
    int *y;
    y = x;
    *y = 4
    return *x;

Let's get formal about the syntax of our language:

    e ∈ expr ⩴ i | e+e | e*e 
             | b | if e then e else e 
             | x | let x = e in e
             | fun x ⇒ e | e e
             -- new stuff
             | box e
             | !e
             | e ← e

    v ∈ value ⩴ i | b | ⟨ fun x ⇒ e , γ ⟩ | ℓ
    ℓ ∈ location ≜ ℕ

    γ ∈ env ≜ var ⇀ value
    σ ∈ store ≜ location ⇀ value

    a ∈ answer ≜ maybe(value × store)

`location` values are the runtime representation of a box. The location `l` is
a unique identifier for a particular box. Creating a new box always generates a
fresh, unique identifier.

Note that values contain environments (in the case of closures), but *do not*
contain stores.

Also, we define answers using the `maybe` set, analogous to the `Maybe` type in
Haskell. The old answer type:

    a ∈ answer ⩴ v | bad

is represented in Haskell as `maybe(v)`. The change in moving to state is that
now, if the program succeeds, it not only returns the resulting value, but the
“updated” store as a consequence of evaluation. The definition `answer ≜
maybe(value × store)` is equivalent to the following definition:

    a ∈ answer ⩴ ⟨v,σ⟩ | bad

that is, it's either a pair of a value and a store, or it's `bad`.

The store is a manifestation of “all of the boxes in the program execution, and
what they point to”

The shape of the interpreter is now:

    ⟦_⟧ ∈ expr → env × store → maybe(value × store)

The idea is that the environment represents the *static* context of the
program, along with the runtime values mapped to lexical variables. The may
*grow* as we introduce new variables into scope, however any growth of the
environment is local to a subexpression, and one subterm may not influence the
environment of another subterm somewhere else in the program. For example, in
`let x = 1 in e + x`, there is no expression you can put for `e` that will
change the value of `x`—it will always be 1, as determined by the static
structure of the program.

The store represents the *dynamic* context of the program, along with runtime
values mapped to dynamically allocated locations (boxes). The store *does*
change during execution, both by updating existing mappings from locations to
values, to allocating new, fresh mappings from locations to values. Subterms
*can* communicate through the store. For example, in `let x = box 1 in e + !x`,
if you put `x ← 10` in place of `e` it will *change* the value inside of the
  box that `x` maps to, and `!x` will then evaluate to `10`.

# Review: Environments and Functions

Last time we talked about adding environments to the language instead of
substitution. That is, instead of interpreting a program like so:

    interp(
    LET x = 1 + 1 IN
    LET y = x + x IN
    x + y
    )
    =
    interp(
    LET y = (1 + 1) + (1 + 1) IN
    (1 + 1) + y
    )
    =
    interp(
    (1+1) + (1+1)+(1+1)
    )
    = 
    6

We perform the substitutions “lazily” and keep track of which substitutions
should be performed:

    interp(
    γ = ∅
    e = LET x = 1 + 1 IN
        LET y = x + x IN
        x + y
    )
    =
    interp(
    γ = {x↦2}
    e = LET y = x + x IN
        x + y
    )
    =
    interp(
    γ = {x↦2,y↦4}
    e = x + y
    )
    =
    6

We also introduced functions into our language as new syntactic forms:

    f ∈ fun-name
    e ∈ expr ⩴ n | e+e | e×e | b | IF e THEN e ELSE e | x | LET x = e IN e
             | f(e,…,e)
    d ∈ defn ⩴ DEF f(x,…,x) ⩮ e
    p ∈ prog ⩴ d … d DO e

and the structure of the interpreter included both a top-level function
definition environment (which does not change), and a substitution environment
(which grows as substitutions “lazily” occur)

    env ∈ var ⇀ value

    interp ∈ list(defn) × env × expr → answer

Today's lecture is about eliminating the need for separate syntactic categories
`defn` and `prog`, as well as eliminating the need for a global definition list
as a parameter to the interpreter.

# Functions II

A quote from the Scheme programming language definition:

> Programming languages should be designed not by piling feature on top of
> feature, but by removing the weaknesses and restrictions that make additional
> features appear necessary.

We are essentially going to explore the following question:

*Why can't function definitions be expressions?*

We are immediately faced with another question.

*If expressions interpret to values, and functions are expressions… what value
does a function mean?*

We are going to add functions to our language with the following syntax:

    e ∈ expr ⩴ n | e+e | e×e | b | IF e THEN e ELSE e | x | LET x = e IN e
             -- new things 
             | FUN (x,…,x) ⇒ e
             | e(e,…,e)

Our old language had the structure of a list of definitions followed by an
expression, like so:

    -- 3²+4²
    DEF f(x,y) = x + y
    DEF g(x,y) = x × y
    DO f(g(3,3),g(4,4)) 

Now that functions are themselves expressions, we can translate this to our new
language:

    LET f = FUN (x,y) ⇒ x + y IN
    LET g = FUN (x,y) ⇒ x × y IN
    f(g(3,3),g(4,4))

and get rid of the list of definitions—functions are now values mapped directly
in the environment

    interp : env × expr → answer
              ^
     functions are mapped to variables here

Remember, a definition from before contained the information from a function:

    d ∈ defn ⩴ DEF f(x,…,x) ≛ e

In our new approach using let statements, we have separated out the *name* of
the function `f` from the parameters `x,…,x` and body of the function `e`. The
“value” for the function `FUN (x,y) ⇒ x + y` is (for now) just this
information.

    v ∈ value ⩴ i
              | b
              | FUN (x,…,x) ⇒ e

I.e., the term for functions contains syntax (`e`), and the value for functions
are identical, and so also contain syntax (`e`).

Let's look at the formal interpretations of variables, function creation, and
function application:

    interp ∈ env × expr → answer
    interp(γ,x) ≜ γ(x)
    interp(γ,FUN (x₁,…,xₙ) ⇒ e) ≜ FUN (x₁,…,xₙ) ⇒ e
    interp(γ,e(e₁,…,eₙ)) ≜ interp(γ[x₁↦v₁,…,xₙ↦vₙ],e′)
      where
        FUN (x₁,…,xₙ) ⇒ e′ = interp(γ,e)
                        vᵢ = interp(γ,eᵢ)

Let's try this out on our example above:

    interp(
      γ = ∅
      e = LET f = FUN (x,y) ⇒ x+y IN
          f(1,2) ⟧
    )
    =
    interp(
    γ = ∅
    e = LET f = FUN (x,y) ⇒ x + y IN
        LET g = FUN (x,y) ⇒ x × y IN
        f(g(3,3),g(4,4))
    )
    =
    interp(
    γ = {f↦FUN(x,y) ⇒ x+y
        ,g↦FUN(x,y) ⇒ x×y}
    e = f(g(3,3),g(4,4))
    )
    =
    interp(
    γ = {f↦FUN(x,y) ⇒ x+y
        ,g↦FUN(x,y) ⇒ x×y}
    e = f((FUN(x,y) ⇒ x×y)(3,3),(FUN(x,y) ⇒ x×y)(4,4))
    )
    =
    interp(
    γ = {f↦FUN(x,y) ⇒ x+y
        ,g↦FUN(x,y) ⇒ x×y}
    e = f(9,16)
    )
    = 
    25

The current definition of function values works OK for this example, but let's
try another:

    LET y = 1 IN
    LET f = FUN (x) ⇒ x + y IN
    LET y = 100 IN
    f(2)

In a *substitution* semantics, this program would evaluate as follows:

    LET y = 1 IN
    LET f = FUN (x) ⇒ x + y IN
    LET y = 100 IN
    f(2)
    ≈
    LET f = FUN (x) ⇒ x + 1 IN
    LET y = 100 IN
    f(2)
    ≈
    LET y = 100 IN
    (FUN (x) ⇒ x + 1)(2)
    ≈ 
    (FUN (x) ⇒ x + 1)(2)
    ≈
    2 + 1
    ≈
    3

The idea behind an *environment-based* semantics is that the environment
“remembers” the substitutions that should have happened so far. However, the
environment where `y` maps to `1` is *lost* by the time the subexpression
`f(2)` is evaluated.

The solution to this is to keep around the environment (i.e., delayed
substitutions) that was around when a function is created. The correct value
space for functions then looks like:

    γ ∈ env ≜ var ⇀ value
    v ∈ val ⩴ i | b 
            | ⟨ FUN (x,…,x) ⇒ e , γ ⟩
                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   ^
                the function      the environment 
                                  when the function 
                                  was “created”

The formal semantics for function creation and application are then as follows:

    interp(γ,FUN (x₁,…,xₙ) ⇒ e) ≜ ⟨ FUN (x₁,…,xₙ) ⇒ e  ,  γ ⟩
    interp(γ,e₀(e₁,…,eₙ))       ≜ interp(γ′[x₁↦ v₁,…,xₙ↦vₙ],e′)
      where
        ⟨ FUN (x₁,…,xₙ) ⇒ e′  ,  γ′ ⟩ = interp(γ,e₀)
                                   vᵢ = interp(γ,eᵢ)

### Programming paradigms

You may have heard of “programming paradigms”

- Procedural programming
- Imperative programming
- Structured programming
- Functional programming
- Object-oriented programming
- Logic programming
- Declarative programming
- Domain-specific languages

Categorizing languages in “paradigms” was very popular for a long time, but
doing so has fallen out of favor in most programming communities. I remember
when it was a big deal that Scala was a “multi-paradigm” language because it
combined procedural programming with functional programming. Any attempt at
defining these paradigms with a any precision degenerates into their
definitions not being very useful.

### Language-based technologies

- First class functions
- Pointers
- Recursive functions and datatypes
- Memory management
- Macros
- Continuations
- Types
- Contracts
- Program synthesis
- Constraint solvers
- Program analysis
- Verification
- Concurrency
- Parallelism

Your primary experience with programming so far has probably been largely (1)
do you like the syntax, and (2) were the libraries you needed to use easy to
use. It is hard sometimes to separate out the following components of a
“programming language”:

- Syntax (“python looks nice”)
- Ease of installation (“python is everywhere”)
- Compiler interface (“python is easy to play with”)
- Builtin libraries (“python is very powerful out of the box”)
- Library ecosystem (“there's a python library for everything”)
- Semantics (“what does this python program mean?”).

It's not always obvious how *features combine*. To answer such a question
requires a detailed account of a programming language's semantics. C has been
out for >45 years and we still aren't sure what some weird C programs mean.

This class is all about *semantics*. We will not be concerned with syntax, ease
of installation, compiler interface, builtin libraries or library ecosystem. In
fact, we will not study any particular language at all. We will study tiny,
core subsets of programming languages in order to study programming language
features in isolation.

### Takeaway from today

- People have been designing programming languages since the 50s. Nobody thinks
  we are done designing programming languages.
- All of the languages that are popular today will become unpopular very soon.
- On the plus side, there are people who get paid lots of $$$ to maintain
  legacy systems written in COBOL and Pascal.
- Learn the ingredients that go into designing programming languages before you
  try to design your own. Give designing your own language a try though. It's
  tons of fun! There is a dark corner of stackoverflow dedicated to
  non-intuitive javascript behavior because its designer didn't properly
  understand variable scoping.

### Old School

- Assembly (1949)
- Fortran (1957)
  - birth of “procedural programming” (part 1)
  - created for calculations and physics simulations
- Lisp (1958)
  - birth of "functional programming" (part 1)
  - [X] authors interested in foundations of *computation* (vs Turing Machines)
  - intended in part for artificial intelligence (chess)
  - [X] birth of self-modifying code
  - [X] birth of garbage collection (seen as too inefficient to ever work until
    Java made it popular)
- COBOL (1959)
  - reads like “human language” (do you agree??)
  - for business logic (records, accounting, document storage)
- ALGOL 60 (1960)
  - birth of "procedural programming" (part 2)
  - birth of "functional programming" (part 2)
  - first “design by committee” language
  - first “formally defined” language
  - first “general purpose” language
  - authors interested in foundations of *programming languages*
    (syntax+semantics)
  - way ahead of its time
    - [X] birth of block structure (begin ... end)
    - [X] birth of lexical scope
    - [X] formal description of syntax + semantics (e.g., BNF)
    - [X] birth of foundations for recursion (foundations + implementation,
      recursion having a well-defined meaning was controversial at the time)
  - *we are still coming to grips with how much ALGOL 60 got right about
    language design all the way back in 1960*
- APL (1966)
  - multidimensional arrays
  - dense, mathematical syntax, special characters
  - first "domain specific language" (IMO)
- Pascal (1970) <<< ALGOL 60
  - general purpose, successfully adopted in industry

### Middle School

- Smalltalk (1972)
  - [X] birth of “pure object oriented programming” (message passing)
  - late binding and dynamic dispatch
  - virtualized programming environments
  - revolutionized GUI and event-based programming
- Prolog (1972)
  - [X] birth of “logic programming”
  - [X] program synthesis
  - intended for search and optimization problems, e.g., AI
- C (1972)
  - invented as “portable assembly” for implementing operating systems (UNIX)
  - one of the most heavily influential programming language designs
- ML (1973)
  - “meta-language”
  - intended for defining formal semantics of programming languages
  - accidently very useful and powerful enough for general purpose programming
  - [X] Haskell's closest ancestor
- SQL (1974)
  - birth of “database query languages”
  - cemented the value of highly domain specific languages embedded in general
    purpose languages
- Scheme (1975)
  - popularized “control operators” and “hygienic macros”
  - minimalist design, formal specification
- Common Lisp (1984)
  - a “practical” lisp that wasn't minimalist in design
  - an “efficient” lisp for impelementing low level systems (operating systems,
    servers)
- MATLAB (1984)
  - domain specific language for scientific computing, analytical mathematics,
    statistics, etc.
- Objective C (1984)
  - a message-passing-based (smalltalk) object-oriented programming paradigm
    fused with C
- C++ (1985)
  - a static-dispatch object-oriented proramming paradigm fused with C
- Caml (1985)
  - stands for “categorical abstract machine”
  - initially thought that category theory would revolutionize compiler
    implementation
- Coq (1989)
  - proof assistant for checking mathematical proofs
  - dependently typed programming language
  - currently state of the art in construction of verified software
- Erlang (1986)
  - revolutionized distributed computing
  - widely used by telecom industry
- Perl (1987)
  - mother of all scripting languages
  - popularized the use of regular expressions
- Python (1990)
  - popularized indentation-sensitive parsing
- Haskell (1990)
  - popularized “pure” functional programming
- R (1993)
  - workhorse language for statistics and data analysis
- Ruby (1995)
  - popularized web programming frameworks, e.g., “Ruby on Rails”
- Java (1995)
  - pitched as cross platform programming language; in the end it amounted to
    “cross platform bytecode” and isn't a major selling point anymore. 
  - Lots of engineering went into JVM, driving innovations in compiler and
    language runtime technology for decades.
  - Marketing + enterprise contracts = success
- Javascript (1995)
  - Java syntax + Scheme semantics (+ a few unintended bugs)
  - semantically nothing like Java, only intended to look like Java.
  - semantically based on Scheme
- PHP (1995)
  - started as subset of Perl for server-side web programming.
  - grew into a monster
- Racket (1995)
  - split from Scheme, starting as merely a variant dubbed “PLT Scheme”
  - vehicle for language research for decades

### New School

- C# (2000)
  - Microsoft's answer to Java
- Scala (2004)
  - A “multi-paradigm” language combining Java with functional programming
- F# (2005)
  - Microsoft's answer to ML/Haskell
- Agda (2007)
  - An alternative to Coq for computer-checked proofs and dependently typed
    programming
- Go (2009)
  - Google's new “systems scripting language”
  - designed explicitly with support for concurrency in mind
- Rust (2010)
  - Mozilla's new “safe systems” language
  - Likely to improve security of crucial software infrastructure like OS's,
    web browsers, etc.
- Julia (2012)
  - A new take on languages for scientific computing, heavily inspired
    (semantically) by Lisp
- Idris (2012)
  - A dependently typed programming language inspired by Haskell, Coq and Agda
- TypeScript (2012)
  - Microsoft's take on typed scripting language for the browser
- Swift (2014)
  - Apple's take on a new general purpose programming language for building
    desktop and server backend applications. (intended to replace Objective-C)

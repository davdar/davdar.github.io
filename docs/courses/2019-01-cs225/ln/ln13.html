# Announcements

1. Midterm will be returned at end of class on Thursday
2. There are 3 more assignments. 
   - Each assignment will feature an extra credit problem worth 1% bump to
     final grade each. 
   - The purpose of these extra credit assignments are to allow those who could
     not attend guest lectures to still receive extra credit.
   - Even if you do the assignment in pairs, you must do the extra credit by
     yourself.
   - ***You cannot receive more than 3.5% bump to your final grade through
     extra credit opportunities, which includes guest lectures and the three
     extra credit problems offered.***

# Objects

So far we have studied the following language features:

- Arithmetic expressions
- Conditional expressions (booleans)
- Variables and lexical scope (let)
- First-class functions (closures)
- References and state (boxes)

An underlying theme as we studied each of these features was *orthogonality*:
each of these features (1) are as minimal as possible in the type of
functionality they provide, and (2) make sense independently of all other
features. In this way, we are now understanding the Python program:

    x = 1
    y = x + 1
    …

as

    LET x = 1 IN
    LET y = x + 1 IN
    …

and
    x = 1
    x = x * x
    …

as

    LET x = BOX 1 IN
    LET _ = x ← !x * !x
    …

That is, the features of *scope* and *mutation* are separate, orthogonal
features.

Now we will turn our attention to *object oriented programming*. First… what do
we mean by object oriented programming? This term means lots of different
things to different people. There is no single definition for the term. It is
often called a “programming paradigm”, and even *that* term doesn't have a well
agreed upon meaning. For example, here are some languages that some might call
object oriented:

- Smalltalk
- Java
- C++
- Python
- Javascript

All of these language have a different idea of what an object is, what OO
programming is, and what it isn't.

We actually have all the tools we need (in terms of the above language
features) to *encode* object oriented programs. That is, we could write a
*desugaring* operation that takes expressions in a language with object
oriented features and transforms them into expressions in a language without
such features. Or, we could give meaning to the object oriented programming
language directly, and not through desugaring. We will eventually use both
approaches, but for now we focus on the desugaring of object oriented programs
into our current core language.

Let's look at a simple class and object with methods using Java:

    public class Point {
      private double x;
      private double y;
      private double z;
    
      public Point(double x, double y, double z) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
        this.z = z;
      }
    
      public double getX() {
        return x;
      }
    
      public double getY() {
        return y;
      }
    
    }

Let's describe this datatype using the terminology we have covered in class so
far:

- There is a strong notion of scope: e.g., in the constructor `this.x`
  references the “private field” `x`, whereas `x` references the parameter `x`.
- There is some implicit scoping going on: e.g., in `getX` and `getY` the
  variable references `x` and `y` are implicitly `this.x` and `this.y` because
  there is no “closer” binding for those names in scope (as opposed to the
  constructor).
- A more subtle feature is the notion of “data encapsulation”. That is, the
  object fields `x`, `y` and `z` are marked as `private`, meaning that any code
  that interacts with this object is only allowed to call its methods, and are
  not allowed to access `z`. We actually *have* seen this capability before
  with closures.

The one thing that we have *not* seen so far is name-based access of a value.
For example:

    Point p = new Point(2, 3, 4);
    return p.getX();

This program results in `r` storing the value `2`. This is the new features we
will imbue into our core language.

Let's start with an encoding of this point object, written using the language
features we have seen thus far, as well as a hypothetical “name-based access”
feature.

    LET new-point = FUN (x,y,z) ⇒ 
          LET this-x = x IN
          LET this-y = y IN
          LET this-z = z IN
          OBJECT
            get-x = FUN () ⇒ this-x
            get-y = FUN () ⇒ this-y
    IN
    LET p = new-point(2,3,4) IN
    p.get-x()

A few things to note:

- The “constructor” is just a normal function.
- The function returns a new object with two publicly visible “methods”–a
  method is just a function
- The local field `z` is private–it's visible in the constructor, and *visible
  to all methods*, but not visible to outside uses of the object.

This is a key theme shared between both object-oriented programming and
functional programming: the ability to selectively expose data and
functionality, i.e., the ability to *hide* it.

Let's pump up our example to include *mutable* fields, as well as one method
which is not a usual “getter” or “setter”:

    public class Point {
      private double x;
      private double y;
      private double z;
    
      public Point(double x, double y, double z) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
        this.z = z;
      }
    
      public double getX() {
        return x;
      }
    
      public void setX(double x) {
        this.x = x;
      }
    
      public double getY() {
        return y;
      }
    
      public void setY(double y) {
        this.y = y;
      }
    
      public double getNorm () {
        return Math.sqrt(x * x + y * y + z * z);
      }
    }

Here is the “program”:

    Point p = new Point(2, 3, 4);
    return p.getNorm();

In our representation of this program, we are going to represent the private
fields not just as let statements–since it is not possible to change the value
bound to a let-statement–but as boxes.

Here is the program in our new core language:

    LET new-point = FUN (x,y,z) ⇒
      LET this-x = BOX x IN
      LET this-y = BOX y IN
      LET this-z = BOX z IN
      OBJECT
        get-x = FUN () ⇒ !this-x
        set-x = FUN (x) ⇒ this-x ← x
        get-y = FUN () ⇒ !this-y
        set-y = FUN (y) ⇒ this-y ← y
        get-norm = FUN () ⇒ sqrt(!this-x*!this-x + !this-y*!this-y + !this-z*!this-z)

Notice, again, that `this-z` is not accessible or mutable outside these method
definitions (where it is accessed, but never changed).

# Getting Formal

Getting precise, we will study “simple” object-oriented programming through the
addition of objects to the programming model. There are two ways to interact
with objects:

1. Creating an object by enumerating publicly visible field names and the
   values they map to.

         e ∈ expr ⩴ …
                  | OBJECT fn = e … fn = e

2. Accessing the field of an object.

         e ∈ expr ⩴ …
                  | e.fn

Adn there are new values:

    v ∈ value ⩴ …
              | OBJECT fn = v … fn = v

The interpreter looks the same as before but with these new expressions and
values:

    interp ∈ env × store × expr → answer

In Haskell, we will represent objects as maps from field names to values:

    type ObjectV = Map String Value

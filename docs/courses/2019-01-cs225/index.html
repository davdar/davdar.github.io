### Course Description

What does it mean for a C++ program to be "undefined"? What is the difference
between "proc" and "lambda" in Ruby? What is the difference between "function"
in Javascript and "lambda" in Python? What does "yield" do in the various
programming languages that support it? What is the difference between a
"variable", a "pointer" and a "reference"? What's the difference between a
Javascript "prototype", a Java "class", and a Rust "trait"? If I wanted to
automatically translate python to javascript, and in a way that preserves the
original program's meaning, (1) how would I do it, and (2) how would I know I
did it correctly?

This course will explore topics in programming language design, implementation
and analysis. We will examine existing programming language designs, as well as
give a rigorous mathematical account for core subsets of programming language
features. Finally, we will use this mathematical account of programming
language semantics as a foundation for tools which analyze programs to (a) find
bugs in programs, (b) verify correctness and security properties of programs,
and (c) automatically construct programs which adhere to a specification.

This course is structured around *language interpreters* as an avenue for
exploring language features and mathematical properties of programs. We will
not study any single mainstream programming language, rather we will focus on
smaller toy languages in order to focus on the essence of language features in
isolation. After studying language features through interpreters, we will
relate these features back to mainstream programming languages and discuss
their designs.

Students are expected to implement concepts discussed in the course in the
Haskell programming language, and manipulate mathematical definitions of
programming language semantics on paper. Students will be evaluated through
weekly programming assignments, a midterm exam and a final project. There will
be no final exam.

**Prerequisites:** CS 124 (Data Structures and Algorithms) and CS 125
(Computability and Complexity)

### Administration

**Lecture:** Tuesdays and Thursdays, 1:15–2:30pm, Aiken Center 110  

**Instructor:** [David Darais](http://david.darais.com)   
**Office Hours:** 
- Tuesdays, 4:00–5:00pm, Votey 319
- Wednesdays, 4:00–5:00pm, Votey 319

**TA:** Lindsey Stuntz  
**Office Hours:** 
- Tuesdays, 10:00-12:00pm, CS Conference Room

**Course Piazza:** [CS 225: Programming Languages][Piazza]

[Piazza]: https://piazza.com/class#spring2019/cs225

*Course announcements and discussion will take place on Piazza exclusively.
Questions sent to the instructor or TAs via email will receive the following
reply: “Please post this question to Piazza.” The instructor and TAs are not
required to respond to Piazza questions after 5pm, or any earlier than 24 hours
after the question is posted.*

### Textbook

We will use Shriram Krishnamurthi's [Programming Languages: Application and
Interpretation][PLAI]. The book is freely available online. Although the book
uses Racket for programming examples and exercises, we will be using Haskell.
Aside from this change in implementation language, we will follow the book
quite closely. We will deviate from the book to explore a broad range of
advanced topics towards the end of the course.

[PLAI]: http://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs173/2012/book/

### Software Tools

Throughout the course we will use the [Haskell] programming language. See
[Haskell Setup][HaskellSetup] for instructions on setting up Haskell. We will
use Haskell GHC version 8.6.3 for this course, along with the [Stack] tool for
managing Haskell compiler and package installations.

You may find [Hoogle] useful for looking up documentation of Haskell operators
and functions.

### Policies

**Grades:** Your grade for the course will be calculated as follows: 60%
Assignments, 20% midterm and 20% final project. Grades for assignments will be
calculated based on tests passed in our grading scripts. *I will drop your
lowest assignment grade.* This means that out of the 9 assignments, your best 8
will be used to calculated 60% of your grade, so each assignment is worth 7.5%
of your total grade. Letter grades are calculated in the [usual
way][LetterGrades]. A+ will only be given to students who achieve 97–100% *and*
an outstanding final project.

[LetterGrades]: letter-grades.html

I will grade assignments within one week and post snapshots of your grade after
each assignment. *I will not create new extra credit opportunities for students
who are unhappy with their grades late in the semester.* You will have all of
the information you need to achieve your desired grade by the end of the
course: your grade at any given point in the course, and the formula I will use
to calculate final grades at the end of the course. Students concerned about
their grade should schedule a meeting with me promptly after the midterm.

**Extra Credit:** During the semester there will be ~7 guest lectures from
visiting faculty. *I will give 0.5% extra credit towards your final grade for
each of these lectures that you attend.* To receive extra credit, you must
bring a notepad to the lecture, take notes in person during the lecture, and
then turn your notes in to the instructor or TA personally at the end of the
talk. If you attend all lectures you will receive a ~3.5% bump to your final
grade.

- Guest Lecture 1: Tuesday, February 12, 12–1pm (Systems Security)
- Guest Lecture 2: Thursday, February 14, 12–1pm (CS Theory)
- Guest Lecture 3: Tuesday, February 19, 12–1pm (Systems Security)
- Guest Lecture 4: Friday, February 22, 12–1pm (Systems Security)
- Guest Lecture 5: Tuesday, February 26, 1–2pm (Systems Security) (CLASS CANCELED)
- Guest Lecture 6: ??? (CS Theory)
- Guest Lecture 7: ??? (CS Theory)
- Guest Lecture 8: Monday, March 04, 12–1pm (Systems Security)

**Assignments:** There will be 9 weekly assignments. Each assignment is
released on a Thursday after class and due the following Thursday *before
class*. Your lowest assignment grade will be dropped when calculating final
grades.

**Late Work:** Each assignment will be released after class on a Thursday and
due before class one week later. *Late work will not be accepted.* The purpose
of my policy to drop your lowest homework grade (see above) is to accommodate
situations that interfere with turning in assignments on time: e.g., illness,
travel, extracurricular activities, or other coursework. Please use this “free”
assignment carefully, and only for situations that are truly outside your
control.

**Collaboration and Copying:** Collaboration with peers on the high-level ideas
and approach on assignments is encouraged. *Copying someone else's work is not
allowed.* Any collaboration, even at a high level, must be declared when you
submit your assignment. Every assignment must include a collaboration
statement. E.g., “I discussed high-level strategies for solving problems 2 and
5 with Alex.” 

Obtaining high-level information on the internet is allowed and encouraged if
it helps you learn the material. However, I strongly discourage googling for
answers to homework problems. *Copying code from the internet and submitting
copied content for assignments is not allowed.*

Students caught copying work from peers or submitting copied code from the
internet will be eligible for immediate failure of the course and disciplinary
action by the University. All academic integrity misconduct will be treated
according to [UVM's Code of Academic Integrity][UVM-CAI].

[UVM-CAI]: https://www.uvm.edu/policies/student/acadintegrity.pdf

**Small Group Assignments:** For homeworks 5–9 you will be allowed to work in
groups of size 1–2 (independently or in pairs). You may submit a single
solution to the assignment for 2-person groups.

**Midterm:** The midterm will be closed note, closed book and closed laptop.

**Final Group Project:** For the final project, you will be allowed to work in
groups of size 1–2, however I will expect a larger amount of work to be
completed for groups of 2. For the final project you will do the following, all
of which will be graded:

- Submit a project proposal as part of HW 9
- Submit a project checkpoint each week for two weeks
- Present your project during the last week of classes
- Submit your final project on the last Friday of classes

**Special Topics Lectures:** Possible special topics include:

- Effects, via Monads
- Logic Programming, via MiniKanren
- Software Verification, via LiquidHaskell and/or Dependent Types
- Static Analysis, via Galois Connections
- Memory Safe Languages, via Rust
- Security and Privacy, via Duet

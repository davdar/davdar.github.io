Authorization hooks are access control checks that prevent
unauthorized principals from interacting with some protected
resource, and are used extensively in critical software such as
operating systems, middleware, and server programs. They are often
intended to mediate information flow between subjects (e.g., file
owners), but typically in an ad-hoc manner. In this paper we present
a static type and effect system for detecting whether authorization
hooks in programs properly defend against undesired information flow
between subjects. A significant novelty of our approach is an
integrated abstract interpretation-based tool that guides system
clients through the information flow consequences of access control
policy decisions.
